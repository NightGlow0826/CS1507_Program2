"starred in the 2011 filmdirected by Paris. Du Fu  was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the AnRebellion of, and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest .Although initially he was littleknown to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the " PoetHistorian " and the " PoetSage " by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as " the Chinese Virgil , Horace ,, Shakespeare , Milton , Burns ,,, Hugo or" .Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to " the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality " . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William, is that Chinese poems are typically,context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , " The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we eitherthe poem or fail to understand it altogether " . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the ""used for more limited poets .Most of what is known of Du Fu 's life comes from his poems . His paternal grandfather was Du, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu . Du Fu was born in; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near Luoyang , Henan province  . In later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an , ancestral hometown of the Du family .Du Fu 's mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his aunt . He had an elder brother , who died young . He also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers in his poems , although he never mentions his stepmother .The son of a minor scholarofficial , his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant : study andof the Confucian classics of philosophy , history and poetry . He later claimed to have producedpoems by his early teens , but these have been lost .In the early, he travelled in the/ Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics .concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Chou suggests his failure toconnections in the capital may have been to blame . After this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around Shandong and Hebei .His father died around 740 . Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father 's rank , but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers . He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area , fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs .In the autumn of, he met Li for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as " the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development " because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poetscholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat onesided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Liwas already a poetic star . We have twelve poems to or about Lifrom the younger poet , but only one in the other direction . They met again only once , in.In 746 , he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career . He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister  . He never again attempted the examinations , insteadthe emperor directly in, 754 and probably again in. He married around, and bythe couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in. From 754 he began to have lung problems  , the first of a series ofwhichhim for the rest of his life . It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region .In, he received an appointment asof the Right Commandant 's office of the Crown Prince 's Palace . Although this was a minor post , in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career . Even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept away by events .The AnRebellion began in December, and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years . It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society : the census of 754 recorded 529 million people , but ten years later , the census counted just 169 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed . During this time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant lifeby wars , associatedand imperial. This period ofwas the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Chou has written that , " What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry " . Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child , he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own. Du Fu wrote : on what I have lived through , if even I know such suffering , the common man must surely beby the winds .In, Emperorwas forced to flee the capital and. Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor  , but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang 'an . In the autumn , his youngest son , Du , was born . Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria .He escaped from Chang 'an the following year , and was appointedwhen he rejoined the court in May. This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial . Du Fu 'scompelled him to try to make use of it : he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge . He was arrested but wasin June . He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8 ,, he returned to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces . However , his advice continued to be, and in the summer ofhe was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in. The position was not to his taste : in one poem , he wrote :I am about to screamin the office / Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk .He moved on in the summer of; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine , butbelieves that frustration is a more likely reason . He next spent around six weeks in , where he wrote more than sixty poems .In December, he briefly stayed in . He departed on December 24 for , where he was hosted by localand fellow poetDi . Du subsequently based himself in Sichuan for most of the next five years . By the autumn of that year he was in financial trouble , and sent poemshelp to various acquaintances . He was relieved by Yan Wu , a friend and former colleague who was appointed governor general at. Despite his financial problems , this was one of theand most peaceful periods of his life . Many of Du 's poems from this period are peaceful depictions of his life at " " . In 762 , he left the city to escape a rebellion , but he returned in summerwhen he was appointed an advisor to Yan , who was involved in campaigns against theEmpire .Luoyang , the region of his birthplace , was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762 , and in the spring ofDu Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze , apparently with the intention of making their way there . They traveled slowly , held up by his illhealth  . They stayed in at the entrance to the Threefor almost two years from late spring. This period was Du Fu 's last great poetic flowering , and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense , late style . In autumn, Bobecame governor of the region : he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary .In March, he began his journey again and got as far asprovince , where he died in in November or December 770 , in hisyear . He was survived by his wife and two sons , who remained in the area for some years at least . His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuanin.his life by concluding that , " He appeared to be ason , an affectionate father , a generous brother , a faithful husband , a loyal friend , aofficial , and a patriotic subject . "Below is an example of one of Du Fu 's later works , To MyFriend . Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends , which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces :Criticism of Du Fu 's works has focused on his strong sense of history , his moral engagement , and his technical excellence .Since the Song dynasty , critics have called Du Fu the " poet historian "  . The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor ., he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of China . As Watson notes , this is information " of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era " .Du Fu 's political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation : hishave beenas , " Let us all be less selfish , let us all do what we are supposed to do " . Since his views were impossible to disagree with , hisexpressedenabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history .A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of " poet sage "  , a counterpart to the philosophical sage ,. One of the earliest surviving works , The Song of the , gives voice to theof asoldier in the imperial army and a clearsighted consciousness of suffering . These concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life .Although Du Fu 's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an allconsuming, Hawkes argues that his " famous compassion in fact includes himself , viewed quiteand almost as an" . He therefore " lends grandeur " to the wider picture by comparing it to " his own slightly comical triviality " .Du Fu 's compassion , for himself and for others , was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment . Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu , " everything in this world is poetry " , Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life , calligraphy , paintings , animals , and other poems .Du Fu 's work is notable above all for its range . Chinese critics traditionally used the term , a reference to' description of. Yuanwas the first to note the breadth of Du Fu 's achievement , writing inthat his predecessor , " united in his work traits which previous men had displayed only singly " . He mastered all the forms of Chinese poetry : Chou says that in every form he " either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples " . Furthermore , his poems use a wide range of registers , from the direct andto theand selfconsciously literary . This variety iseven within individual works : Owen identifies the , " rapid stylistic and thematic shifts " in poems which enable the poet to represent differentof a situation , while Chou uses the term " juxtaposition " as the major analytical tool in her work . Du Fu is noted for having written more onand painting than any other writer of his time . He wrote eighteen poems on painting alone , more than any other Tang poet . Du Fu 's seemingly negative commentary on the prized horse paintings of Han a controversy that has persisted to the present day .The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings  : his earliest works are in a relatively derivative , courtly style , but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion . Owen comments on the "simplicity " of thepoems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from hisperiod are " light , often finely observed " ; while the poems from the lateperiod have a " density and power of vision " .Although he wrote in all poetic forms , Du Fu is best known for his, a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content , for example :About two thirds of Du Fu 's 1500 extant works are in this form , and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent . His bestuse therequired by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions . Hawkes comments that , " it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner " .According to theBritannica , Du Fu 's writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it states " his dense , compressed language makes use of all theovertones of a phrase and of all the of the individual word , qualities that no translation can ever reveal . "In his lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated . In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations , some of which are still " considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics . " There are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection , but not as aof poetic or moral ideals . Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry .However , asnotes , he " is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time " , and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came from , who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu 's works  , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Lion aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them . Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work . By the beginning of the 10th century , constructed the first replica of hiscottage in Sichuan .It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive reevaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang, Liand Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist ,and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic, occupied the paramount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was "... because ... through all his, he never for the space of a mealhis sovereign " . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : politicalwere attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literarycould look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . Since the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , Du Fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simple , " people 's language " .Du Fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : 's concern for the poor , Lu You 's patriotism , and 'son theare a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in transforming thefrom mere word play into " a vehicle for serious poetic" set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre .In the 20th century , he was the favourite poet of Kenneth, who has described him as " the greatest nonepic , nondramatic poet who has survived in any language " , and commented that , " he has made me a better man , as a moral agent and as aorganism " .Du Fu 's poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature , especially on the literature from theperiod and on scholars and poets in the Edo period , including , the very greatest of allpoets . Even in modern Japanese , the term Saint of Poetry  is mostly synonymous with Du Fu .Until the 13th century , the Japanese preferred above all poets and there were few references to Du Fu , although his influence can be seen in some anthologies such as in the 9th century . The first notable Japaneseof Du Fu 's poetry was  , a patriarch and one of the most prominent authors of the literature of the Five Mountains ; he highly praised Du Fu and made a commentary on some poems of Du Fu from the perspective of apriest in Vol . 11 of. His student composed manywhich were clearly stated " influenced by Du Fu " in their.'s student had close connection with the Court and andDu Fu 's poetry in the mundane world ; one day , theregent of the Court and the highest authority ofpoetry , asked, " Should I learn the poetry of Du Fu and Li? " to reply , " Yes if you do have enough capability . No if do not . " Since then , there had been manyon Du Fu 's poetry both intemples and in the aristocratic society , and as a result his poetry was often cited in Japanese literature in theperiod , e.g. ,, a historical epic in the late 14th century , and someplays such as,, and.During the Kanera of the Edo period  ,  of the Ming Dynasty 's on Du Fu 's was imported into Japan , and it gained explosive popularity in Confucian scholars and class . The commentary established Du Fu 's fame as the highest of all poets ; for instance , , a notable Confucian scholar , commented in Vol . 37 of that[ Du Fu ] was the very best poet in history and praised 's commentary for its simplicity and readability , while he criticized old commentaries during the Yuan Dynasty were too. , the greatestpoet , was also strongly influenced by Du Fu ; inno, his masterpiece , he cites the first two lines of A Spring View  before aas its introduction and also many of his otherhave similar wording and themes . It is said that when he died in Osaka during a long travel , a copy of Du Fu 's poetry was found with him as one of a few precious items which he was able to carry around .A variety of styles have been used in efforts to translate Du Fu 's work into English . As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu , " There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu , which is why we need as many different translations as possible "  . The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without soundingto a Western ear  , andthe complex allusions contained particularly in the later works  . One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese . His are free translations , which seek to conceal thethroughand expansion and contraction of the content ; his responses to the allusions are firstly tomost of these poems from his selection , andto " translate out " the references in those works which he does select .Other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu . Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses Englishstyle rhyme schemes , whereas Keithin Facing the Moonthe Chinese rhyme scheme ; both use endstopped lines and preserve some degree of. In The Selected Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows thequite strictly , persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa . Similarly , he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive.In 2015 , Stephen Owen published translations , with facing Chinese texts , of the complete poetry of Du Fu in six volumes , with extensive scholarly apparatus , which emphasized.

The class battleships  were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy  during World War I. Originally intended to be repeats of the precedingclass , they were redesigned before construction began . Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Greatearthquake in 1923 . They were modernized in 1934 – 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . Afterwards they played a minor role in the Second Japanese War .Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of. A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Capein late 1944 , where theythe American carrier fleet supporting the invasion ofaway from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation, where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 .The design of the class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters . The's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905 , the last year of the RussoJapanese War , which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of.In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio ,theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20000 long tons  each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18000 long tons  each . This was the genesis of the EightEight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships .The launch of HMSin 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complicated Japan 's plans .17900 long tons  and armed with ten 12inch  guns ,rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison . The launch of the battlecruiser HMS Invincible the following year was a further setback for Japan 's quest for parity . When the two new class battleships and two class armoured cruisers , launched by 1911 , wereby their British counterparts , the EightEight Fleet Program was.The first battleships built for the renewed EightEight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of theclass , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet  to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of theclass were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more class ships  were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 . Whilewas laid down later that year , thelacked the funding to proceed with the construction ofanduntil the Diet authorized additional funding for the ships in July 1914 .The progress of's construction , while thewaited for the funding to be released and foreign developments , caused thetothe class design . The distribution of thegun turrets was the most obvious flaw as they complicated the protection of themagazine and exposed more of the ship to the blast effects of the guns when they fired . Another issue was that Japanese sailors had problems maintaining a high rate of fire with the 4536kilogram  shells used in the manually loaded 152millimetre  secondary guns used in theclass and earlier designs . To resolve this issue , thedesigned a smaller 140millimetre  gun that offset its lighter shell weight with a higher rate of fire . It also decided that the barbette armour of the earlier ships was too thin and wanted a modest increase in speed to partially counter the higher speeds of the latest foreign ships like the British Queen Elizabethclass battleships and Russian class battlecruisers . For financial reasons more powerful engines could not be ordered so the new design was lengthened slightly and the boiler rooms enlarged to increase speed by 05 knots  to 23 knots  . To save weight the forecastle deck was shortened so that the lowergun turret was lower than in theclass . This reduced the crew 's accommodations despite a significant increase in the crew 's numbers and naval historian believed that these ships had the worstof any Japanese capital ship . The final design was designated A92 by theand differed enough from the A64 design of theclass that it was considered a separate class .The ships had a length of 20818 metres  overall , a beam of 2865 metres  and a draught of 893 metres  at deep load . They displaced 36500 long tons  at deep load , roughly 650 long tons  more than the preceding class . Their crew consisted of 1360 officers and enlisted men . They had aheight of 1737 metres  at deep load .During the ships ' modernization during the 1930s , their forwardwere enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod. Both ships were also given torpedoto improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour . In addition , theirwere lengthened by 762 metres  . These changes increased their overall length to 2138 metres  , their beam to 3175 metres  and their draft to 945 metres  . Their displacement increased over 5000 long tons  to 42001 long tons  at deep load . The crew now numbered 1 officers and enlisted men .The class ships had two sets of directdrive steam turbines , each of which drove two propeller shafts with 3metre  propellers . The highpressure turbines drove the wing shafts while the lowpressure turbines drove the inner shafts . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 40000 or 45000 shaft horsepower   , using steam provided by 24watertube boilers at working pressures of 13 – 169 kg / . Both ships comfortably exceeded their designed speed of 23 knots  during their sea trials ;reached 236 knots  from 56 shp  andexceeded that with 24 knots  from 63 shp  . Each of the boilers consumed a mixture of coal and oil and the ships had a stowage capacity of 4 long tons  of coal and 1 long tons  of fuel oil , which gave them a range of 9680 nautical miles  at a speed of 14 knots  .andhad three generators of 150 capacity and two 250 generators at 225 volts .During their 1930s modernization , the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight newoilfired boilers , fitted into the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed . The turbines were replaced by four gearedturbines with a designed output of 80000 shp  intended to increase their speed to 245 knots  . On her trials ,reached a top speed of 2526 knots  from 81050 shp  . The fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of 5113 long tons  of fuel oil that gave them a range of 7 nautical miles  at a speed of 16 knots  .The twelve 45calibre 356 cm  Type 41 guns of theclass were mounted in three pairs of twingun , superfiring turrets .one through six from front to rear , each turret weighedlong tons  . Thepowered turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 / + 20 degrees . The guns had a rate of fire of 15 – 2 rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle betweenand + 20 degrees . In 1921 the elevation was increased to + 30 degrees and then to + 43 degrees during their mid1930s modernization , except for No. 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered . Themechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to asystem , which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns .By World War II , the guns used Type 91 armourpiercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed 5 kilograms  and was fired at a muzzle velocity of 770 – 775 metres per second  . They had a maximum range of 25000 metres  at + 20 degrees of elevation and 35450 meters  at + 43 degrees after modernization . Also available was a 625kilogram  highexplosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 metres per second  . A special Type 3incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for antiaircraft use .The ships ' secondary armament consisted of twenty 50calibre 14 Type 3 . Eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields . They had a maximum elevation of + 20 degrees which gave them ranges of 16300 metres  . Each gun had a rate of fire of up to 10 rounds per minute . Antiaircraft defence was provided by four 40calibre 3rd Year Type 8 AA guns in single mounts . The 762  highangle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . They fired a 6 kg with a muzzle velocity of 680 m / s  to a maximum height of 7500 metres  . The ships were also fitted with six submerged 533  torpedo tubes , three on each broadside . They carried twelve to eighteen 6th Year Type torpedoes which had a 200kilogram  warhead . They had three settings for range and speed : 15000 metres  at 26 knots  , 10000 metres  at 32 knots  , or 7000 metres  at 37 knots  .In 1931 – 33 the AA guns were replaced with eight 40caliber 127 cm  Type 89 dualpurpose guns , fitted on both sides of the forwardin four twingun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14700 metres  ; they had a ceiling of 9440 metres  at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two twingun mounts for licensebuilt Vickers twopounder light AA guns were also added . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 80 degrees and a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute . The pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time .During the mid1930s reconstruction the torpedo tubes were removed and the Vickers twopounders were replaced by twenty licensebuilt25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in 10 twingun mounts . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark, the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . These 25millimetre  guns had an effective range of 1500 – 3000 metres  , and an effective ceiling of 5500 metres  at an elevation of 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteenround magazines . In addition the forward pair of 14 cm guns in the forecastle were removed at this time and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to + 30 degrees .The class ships ' waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness ofmm  of Vickers cemented armour amidships ; below it was aof 100 mm  armour . The upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of hightensile steel 55 mm  thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of hightensile steel , but only 30 mm  thick . The sides of this deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom of the lowerof the belt armour . The ends of the belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that ranged in thickness from 203 to 102 mm  . The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of 254 mm  on the face and 76 mm on the roof . The casemate armour was 149 mm  thick and that of the barbettes wasmm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm . The sides of the conning tower were 305 mm thick .Theclass were the only Japanese battleships to place the powder magazine above the shell magazine as thewished to put as much space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo. The danger fromshells at long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three British battlecruisers during the 1916 Battle of Jutlanddemonstrated the point . To further protect the magazines the depth of the double bottom was increased to a total of 358 metres  underneath the barbettes and magazines . Additionally , the vessels contained 660compartments to preservein the event of battle damage . In addition to the torpedoadded when the ships were modernized , the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness of 140 mm . Inside the original skin of the ships , two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total of 152 millimetres  of armour .While the details of the ship 's firecontrol instruments are not fully available , it is known that the ships were fitted with a firecontrol director after completion . No computer was fitted at that time and data from the rangefinders had to be processed manually .2 , 3 , and 5 were built with imported 6metre &rangefinders . These were felt to be inferior to the British& Stroud instruments used on other ships and were removed in 1920 . They were replaced by either the British rangefinders or domestically built instruments of 6 or 8 metres  length . In the late 1920s the firecontrol systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them . A pair of directors for the 127 cm AA guns were added , one on each side of the forward superstructure , in the early 1930s . The firecontrol systems were again upgraded in the mid1930s and directors were added for the 25 mm AA guns . Both ships had 10metre  rangefinders installed at the top of the pagoda mast at that time . Type 21 airsearchwere installed aboard the sisters in mid1942 . was briefly fitted with an aircraft flyingoff platform for a fighter onNo. 2 in 1927 . It was replaced by a platform onNo. 5 for a reconnaissancein 1928 – 29 . A catapult and a4  crane were fitted on the stern during the mid1930s modernization , and the ships were equipped to operate three, although no hangar was provided . The initial Nakajima were replaced by Nakajima in 1938 .The sinking of the British capital ships Prince of Wales and Repulse by Japanese landbased aircraft on 10 December 1941 led theto realize that battleships could not operate in the face of enemy aircraft and required friendly air support to protect them . The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in June 1942 severely limited the ability of theto provide any air cover andwere sought . Earlier proposals to convert one or more battleships into carriers had been made and rejected at the beginning of the war , but they were revived after Midway . Plans for more elaboratewere rejected on the grounds of expense and , most critically , time , and thesettled on removing the rear pair of turrets and replacing them with a flight deck equipped with twoto launch. The class ships were selected for the conversion becausehad suffered an explosion inNo. 5 in early May that virtually destroyed the turret and theirNo. 6 could not elevate to the full + 43 degrees deemed necessary for the longrange engagement anticipated by the. Thewere scheduled to follow once the first two were completed .The rear turrets , the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour . All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off . Four additional twin 127 cm mounts were added , one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower . The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added , a total of 57 guns . Two each Type 94 and Type 95 AA directors were added to control the additional guns . The ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the 14 cm guns and forNo. 5 . During 1944 , the ships ' AA defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25 mm gun mounts , for a total of 104 barrels , and a pair of Type 13 early warningwere added . In September six 30round AA rocket launchers were added on the sides of the flight deck .A 70metrelong  flight deck was built above the stern and stretched forward to the rebuilt aft superstructure . The flight deck was 29 metres  wide at its forward end and 13 metres  at the stern . Itthe stern and increased the overall length of the ships to 21962 metres  . A pair of rotating gunpowderpropelledwere fitted on the sides of the hull , forward of the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc of fire of the two amidships turrets . They could launch aircraft up to 4600 kilograms  in weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft . The flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to theand theoperated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trolleys used to move theabout . Two aircraft were intended to beon theand three more in temporary positions on the flight deck for a total of thirteen .The 40metrelong  hangar was 20 metres  wide forward and 11 metres  at the rear . It was 6 metres  high and designed tonine aircraft . It was fitted with fire fightingand carbon dioxideas a result of wartime experience . The ' T 'lift was 121 metres  wide at its forward end and 66 metres  wide at the its aft end . It was 121 metres long and had a capacity of 6 tonnes  .storage tanks with a capacity of 76 tonnes  were installed in the former magazine ofNo. 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for three sorties . To recover the aircraft thecrane formerly on the stern was moved up to the port side of the flight deck . Another crane was intended on the starboard side , but it was never fitted .The ships had an air group of 11 each of dive bombers  and reconnaissance aircraft  Both aircraft had development problems and neither air group ever had all of its intended aircraft . Coupled with a shortage of trained pilots , neither ship ever used its aircraft during combat .After the loss of the fast battleshipat the Naval Battle ofin late 1942 to rudder damage , thedecided to reinforce the protection of the steering compartment and to create an auxiliary steering compartment . The protection of the former was strengthened by the addition of a concrete wall at least 1 metre  in thickness and some of the armour removed from the turrets was used to protect the latter . The double bottom below the former positions of aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil ; this increased the ships ' endurance to 9500 nautical miles  at a speed of 16 knots . A pair of Type 22 surfacesearchwere also fitted during the conversion .The removal of the secondary armament , the rear turrets and their supporting structures was generally compensated by the addition of the flight deck , hangar , AA guns and more fuel , and theheight increasedmetres  to 281 metres  at full load as a result of the reduction in the displacement by over 2000 tonnes  to 40 tonnes  . This also reduced the draught to 903 metres  . The overhang of the flight deck at the stern increased the overall length to 21962 metres  and the beam was slightly reduced to 3171 metres  .Upon commissioning , the sister ships were assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet .had an explosion in one of her main gun turrets that killed 11 men and injured 25 in 1919 ; the following year she accidentally collided with and sank a schooner , losing two crewmen . Before the start of the Pacific War , both ships frequently exercised off the coasts of the Soviet Union , Korea and China in addition to training in Japanese waters .hosted Edward , Prince of Wales , and his aidedecamp Lieutenant Louisin 1922 during the prince 's visit to Japan . In Korea Bay when the 1923 Greatearthquake struck , they sailed towhere they loaded supplies from for the victims on 4 September . Together with two other battleships and a pair of light cruisers ,sank the destroyerin 1926 during gunnery practice .'s AA armament was upgraded in 1931 and's two years later . The latter ship was modernized in 1934 – 36 andin 1935 – 37 , both atNaval Arsenal . During the Second Japanese War , the sisters frequently patrolled the Chinese coast in support of the blockade imposed by Japan . In August 1937ferried two battalions of Special Naval Landing Forces to Port Arthur . Three years later , she served as the flagship for the Emperor of the puppet state of, Henry, during his state visit to Japan in June 1940 . On 15 November the ships were transferred to the 2nd Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet . The sisters were refitted in late 1940 in preparation for war , which included the fitting of external and additional AA directors .When Japan began the Pacific War on 8 December , the sisters sortied for theIslands with four other battleships and the light carrieras distant cover for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . On 11 March 1942andsortied from their anchorage atto join the unsuccessful search for the American carrier force that had attacked Marcus Island a week earlier . Similarly they pursued but did not catch the American carriers that had launched theRaid on 18 April .During gunnery training on 5 May , there was a premature detonation in the left gun of'sNo. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen . Both aft magazines were flooded tothe resulting fire and save the ship . She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25 mm gun mounts were positioned . On 11 May a valve in's No. 2 engine room stuck in the open position and flooded the engine room . While under repair at, both ships received prototype Type 21.by ViceAdmiral , the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with theSupport Group on 28 May , at the same time that most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island  .They returned home on 14 June and thebegan preliminary planning to replace the lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships . The sisters were selected for conversion and detached from the division on 14 July in preparation . They remained on " standby alert " until the actualbegan .was converted atNaval Arsenal from 23 February to 5 September 1943 andatNaval Arsenal from 2 May to 30 November .After completing her sea trials ,was attached to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy atand ferried troops and munitions to the naval base atin October . In November the ship began working up , joined by the newly completedthe following month , and both rejoined the 2nd Battleship Division . On 1 May 1944 , the sisters were transferred to Rear Admiral 's reformed Fourth Carrier Division of the 3rd Fleet . The division 'sNaval Air Group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late June . of aircraft andproblems greatlypilot training and the ships only had a total of 17and 18on hand on 1 October ; of these , only 6 and 16 were operational , respectively . The Japanese plan for the defence of the Philippines envisioned that the surviving carriers would be used to lure the American carrier forces away from the invasion area to a position where the carriers could be attacked by landbased aircraft and the transports by the rest of the. The other carrier air groups were not in much better shape and the Japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the American carriers . The Fourth Carrier Division was assigned to the Northern Force under the command of Vice AdmiralOzawa and the sisters sailed fromon 20 October . On the morning of 24 October , the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the American carriers as a distraction . They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked . The Americans finally spotted the Japanese carriers at 16 : 40 , some 200 miles  east of Cape, the northeastern tip of Luzon . The American carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an, so Admiral William, commander of the Third Fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning . Ozawa reversed course during the night , correctly believing that the Americans would follow him north .Although they had lost contact during the night , the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07 : 35 . They had already launched anof 180 aircraft that was orbiting 50 miles  ahead of the American carriers while waiting for the Japanese ships to be located . This was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the Americans launched that day . The sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstrikes which are focusing on the group 's aircraft carriers .claimed to have shot down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated onNo. 2 .was lightly damaged by near misses that rupture some hull plating in herandher superstructure with splinters . She took on a 5degree list that was quickly corrected before she was ordered to tow the crippled carrierto safety . Her attempt was unsuccessful andhad to be abandoned to her fate . was attacked by 80odd aircraft from the fourth wave , but they failed to inflict any serious damage . She11 torpedoes and was only hit by a bomb once , on the of the port catapult . Some 34 other bombs near missed her , spraying her with splinters andsome hull plates that contaminated some fuel oil and caused leaks in her port boiler rooms . While an exact total of her casualties is not available , it has been estimated that 5 men were killed and some 111 – 121 crewmen were wounded during this attack .was unsuccessfully attacked by an American submarine at 18 : 43 . Around 19 : 00 Ozawa learned about a force of destroyers and cruisers that drove off the Japanese destroyers rescuing survivors from some of the carriers lost earlier in the day and sank. He ordered the Fourth Carrier Division to reverse course and engage the Americans , but the battleships were unable to find them , and Ozawa ordered them to reverse course and head for . When they arrived on 27 October , Ozawa transferred toandhis flag aboard her . While en route for, the division was unsuccessfully attacked by another submarine .In early November thewere removed from both ships , and they loaded troops and munitions later that month . While en route they were diverted to theIslands upon reports of heavy air raids at Manila . After offloading their cargo , they sailed forIsland , near Singapore , on 20 November . They transferred to CamBay , French Indochina andbecame flagship of the 5th Fleet there on 14 December . The division sailed for Singapore on 30 December and Vice Admiral transferred his flag to the light cruiseron arrival there the following day . The division continued onwards to. Its planned return to Japan was delayed by attacks by the American Third Fleet on targets in Indochina and southern China that sank two oil tankers that were intended to refuel the division .Thethen decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol , rubber , tin and other strategic minerals back to Japan after the American carriers departed the South China Sea  . They loaded their cargoes beginning on 6 February at Singapore and departed four days later . Also carrying some 1150workers , they were escorted byand three destroyers .Japanese radio signals revealed the Japanese plan to the Allies , and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships . An additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route , but only three were ultimately able to attack . None of them were successful before the Japanese reachedon 20 February . The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships . On 19 Marchwas attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 andwas hit three times by bombs that killed 37 men and wounded 52 . Her gunners claimed to have shot down one American dive bomber during the attack .was hit twice during the attack , but her casualties , if any , are unknown .The ships were turned into floating AA batteries over the next several months although itthem little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July . On the 24thwas struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times ; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded . The bombs started numerous leaks andbegan to settle by the bow , although she was returned to an even keel after threedays pumping .was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses . She was badly damaged with some 200odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack . She slowlyover the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later . This time it was's turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list . The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war . Richard Gale " Dick " was an American football player and a pioneering television broadcaster for the forerunner to TV in Buffalo . He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 1944 and from 1946 to 1948 . He was a consensus selection at end on the 1948 College Football AllAmerica Team .played professionally in the National Football League  with the Detroit Lions for one season in 1950 . After retiring from football he settled in Buffalo and became a sports broadcaster . He worked as a color commentator and as a playbyplay announcer for the Buffalo Bulls . He hosted various television and radio sports shows and was eventually inducted into the BuffaloHall of Fame .In college , he led the Big Ten Conference in single season receptions during his senior year and set Michigan Wolverines receptions records for both career touchdown and singleseason touchdowns . He had also been a Michigan High School Athletic Association  state champion in both basketball and track and field . His college career was interrupted by World War II service , and his high school career was also affected by the war due to the's cancellation of state championships in all sports in 1943 . was born in, Michigan , and raised in Kalamazoo , Michigan before his family moved to Saginaw , Michigan .was a star athlete at Saginaw 's Arthur Hill High School in football , basketball , and track and field . In 1943 , Michigan canceled boys high school tournaments in all sports due to World War II , and they did not return until the fall of 1944 . In 1944 , he led Arthur Hill High to theClass A high school basketball championship  , scoring 24 points , including 17 in the second half , of the championship game .was also the state champion in 1944 in both the shot put 46 feet 11 inches  and high jump 5 feet 85 inches  . He also led Arthur Hill in football , and his high school accomplishments are featured in Glory : The history of Saginaw County sports by Jack , which is a book on high school sports in Saginaw County , Michigan .was named All State in football , basketball and track .It is ironic thatwas born in, Michigan in 1926 for several reasons . Tedprecededas an AllAmerican end on the University of Michigan football team .had excelled as a representative of Saginaw County incompetition .posted significant football accomplishments in 1926 making 1926 a significant year for himself as well .AllAmerican status as an end at Michigan would be's next step afterincompetition .In the fall of 1944 ,enrolled at the University of Michigan . The United Press syndicate ran a feature article aboutin September 1944 that opened as follows : " Another great end has made his appearance on the Big Ten football horizon in the person of Dick, 18yearold Michigan freshman . Every so often a great offensive end comes along , a player who has to learn how to play defense , but who has the natural speed , smooth actions , height and big hands that is the mark of an outstanding pass receiver .has laid claim to that rating . A loose 180pound freshman from Saginaw ,. ,is beingas the Big Ten 's next ' freshman sensation . ' " As a freshman , he caught two touchdown passes in his first college football game against Iowa . In an article titled "and, " Time reported on's performance : " Of the few teams already in action , Michigan 's teens rang the freshman belllast week by winning their opener , 12 7 , against the strong Iowa Seahawks  ; 6ft . 4 Freshman End Dickcaught passes and ran for both Michigan touchdowns . " 's college career was interrupted by World War II service in the United States Navy , but after missing the 1945 season , he returned to play for the Wolverines from 1946 to 1948 .played for the Wolverines in consecutive undefeated National Championship seasons in 1947 and 1948 . He started nine games for the 1947 team . The 1947 team referred to as " Michigan 's Mad" is considered to be the greatest University of Michigan football team of all time .and teammate Len Ford had the reputation as the team practical. During the 1947 game against Wisconsin ,started calling signals for the. Wisconsin 's offense protested to officials , who "the Wolverines secondary but never caught their man . "continued to scramblesignals , as's teammates laughed at his scheme . In the January 1 , 1948 Rose Bowl that season , Michigan rolled to a 49 – 0 victory over USC , and theythe Trojans 491 yards to 133 .caught a 29yard pass for the game 's final score .In the 1948 championship season ,scored eight touchdowns , caught 22 passes , and gained 610 yards  .was the second highest scoring end in the nation in 1948 , and he was a consensus AllAmerican as a senior , being selected as first team on nine of the 11 AllAmerican teams .led the Big Ten in receptions .Althoughfinished fourth among voters in 1948 , he did not finish among the top eight . By comparison , Notre Dame end Leon Hart won theTrophy in 1949 but made only eight of the 11 AllAmerican teams . It is not clear whydid not finish higher . However , it is fairly clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias against Michigan . In the Associated Press poll at the end of the 1947 season , the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were ranked ahead of the University of Michigan , though both teams were undefeated . Some noted that every Southern APhad voted for Notre Dame , which had yet to integrate , whereas three of Michigan 's star players  were AfricanAmerican . The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played AfricanAmerican players . was considered one of the greatest's of the 1940s . In four seasons with the Michigan Wolverines ,played in 32 games and had over 1000 yards of total offense .held the University of Michigan 's single season and career record for touchdown receptions  until his records were broken by Anthony Carter in 1980 .In 1948 ,was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 15th round of the NFL draft , and he was also drafted by the New York Yankees of the AllAmerica Football Conference . He had intended to play in 1949 with the Yankees , but suffered a knee injury in a practice session for the August 1949 Chicago College AllStar Game . Press accounts at the time noted that the injury " will probably keep him out of pro football all season , if not forever . " The incident led to a debate as to whether NFL owners should " bar their men from playing with the college allstars . " landed a job atradio in Detroit , but he left his's job to join the Detroit Lions . In the 1950 NFL season ,came back from his injury to play for the Detroit Lions . He played in 12 games and had ten receptions for 96 yards and one touchdown for the 1950 Lions .recalled that his playing time with the Lions was limited because the Lions also signed 1949Trophy winner Leon Hart , who played the same position .In May 1951 , he announced he was retiring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in Buffalo . He was hired as aby , which had just started the first television station in Buffalo and the only one serving Southern Ontario . This was an early foray into television by the Buffalo Evening News .

Doug was a 1988 first team football AllWestern New York linebacker for Clarence High School . The 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane was the secondmost intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season . The eleventh tropical storm , fifth hurricane , and the third major hurricane of the season , it formed eastnortheast of the Leeward Islands on August 31 . The tropical storm moved rapidly westnorthwestward , steadily intensifying to a hurricane . It acquired peak winds of 140 miles per hour  and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3 , includingand Harbour Island , causing severe damage to crops , buildings , and infrastructure . Winds over 100 mph  affected many islands in its path , especially those that encountered its center , and many wharves were ruined .Subsequently , it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter , Florida , early on September 4 with winds of 125 mph  . The hurricane moved across the state , passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating . In Florida , the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations , and numerous trees werein citrus groves . The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction , and Stuart , Jupiter , and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged . Inland , the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain , causing a dam to collapse near Tampa . The storm caused $ 3 million in damage  after damaging or destroying 6 homes .Unusually , the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125mileperhour  winds struck South Texas ; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession .The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on August 27 , although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the westnorthwest . On August 31 , a nearby ship reported gale force winds , which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the eastnortheast of the Lesser Antilles . Based on continuity , it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day . Moving quickly to the westnorthwest , the storm passed north of the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico . Early on September 2 , a ship called thereported a barometric pressure of 978 mbar  , which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status . After passing north of the Turks andislands , the hurricane struckand Harbour Island in the Bahamas on September 3 , the latter at 1100 UTC . A station on the latter island reported a pressure of 2790 inHg  during the 30 minute passage of the eye . Based on the pressure and the small size of the storm , it is estimated the hurricane struck Harbour Island with peak winds of 140 mph  , making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the SaffirSimpson scale .suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status , or Category 3 status , on September 2 .The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late August , which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas . This hurricane instead maintained a general westnorthwest track . After moving through the northern Bahamas , the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at Jupiter , Florida , atUTC on September 4 . A station there reported a pressure of 2798 inHg  during a 40 minute period of the eye 's passage ; this suggested a landfall strength of 125 mph  . At the time , the radius of maximum winds was 15 mi  , which was smaller than average . After landfall , the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state . It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September 5 . A few hours later while continuing to the northwest , it made another landfall near— a ghost town in Levy County , east of Cedar Key — with winds of about 65 mph  . Turning to the north , the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia , dissipating on September 7 near Augusta .On September 2 , a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End , Grand, toBeach , Florida . While the storm was near peak intensity on September 3 , the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne , Florida , with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville . Later that day , storm warnings , were issued from Key West to Cedar Key . About 2500 people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee . By evening on September 3 , high tides sent seaover coastalin Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings ; structures onStreet in West Palm Beach were said to be a " solid front " of. Along the coast , observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land .The powerful hurricane moved over or near several islands in the Bahamas . Winds on Spanish Wells and Harbour Island were both estimated at around 140 mph  . Winds reached 110 mph  at Governor 's Harbour , 100 mph  on, and 120 mph  on theIslands . The storm was farther away from Nassau , where winds reached 61 mph  . The hurricane damaged a lumber mill on,away a dock . Heavy damage occurred on Harbour Island , including to several roofs , the walls of government buildings , and the water system . The hurricane destroyed four churches and 37 houses , leaving 100 people homeless . A 15 mi  road onwas destroyed . Several islands sustained damage to farms , including the total loss of various fruit trees on Russell Island . Despite Category 4 winds on Spanish Wells , only five houses were destroyed , although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs .between North Point , James, and Gregory Town on, the storm destroyed 55 houses and damaged many others . On Grand, where a 9 to 12 ft  storm surge was reported , half of the houses were destroyed , as were 13 boats and two planes , and most docks were wrecked .When the storm moved ashore in Florida , winds reached an estimated 125 mph  in Jupiter ; these occurred after the eye passed . In West Palm Beach ,measured at least 80mileperhour  winds with gusts to 100 mph  ;ranged from 2864 to 2878 inHg  . The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . Winds were not as strong farther from the center ; 40 to 45 mph  winds were observed in Miami to the south ,to the north , and Tampa on the west coast . Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of 80 to 90 mph  , and pressures dipped to 2914 inHg  . Inland , winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only 60 mph  . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 178 in  in.At West Palm Beach , the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation . Severaland royalthat withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped ,streets with broken trunks . Winds downed road signs on many streets , andcovered theon a local golf course . Someand isolated structures , mostly lightweight , were partly or totally destroyed , along with a lumber warehouse . Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well . Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows , including plate glass , and loss of tile androofing , but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars , and no poststorm accidents took place . Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city , and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted . As in Lake Worth , officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage . The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926 , 1928 , and 1929 . High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage , except to vegetation , and county properties went largely unscathed .In Martin and St. Lucie counties , the storm was considered among the worst on record . The storm leveled some homes and swept many others off their foundations . At Stuart , winds removed or badly damaged 75 % of the roofs in town . The storm destroyed the third floor of the building that housed a bowlingand the Stuart News , a local newspaper . At, an abandoned settlement also known asBeach , strong winds leveled the oldInn , a gas station , and the second floor of abuilding . Winds also tore the roof off an ice plant . A bridge leading to the barrier island fromwas partly wrecked ; the bridge tender survived by gripping theduring the storm . Winds leveled his nearby home . According to the Monthly Weather Review , some of the most severe damage from the storm in Florida was at. The storm left many homes inSound, forcing crews to tear them down . Winter estates on the island , however , were better built and little damaged . While Stuart andSound sustained significant damage , Portsuffered. In Stuart , the storm left 400 to 500 people homeless , up to nearly 10 % of the population , which was 5100 at the time . Between Jupiter and Fort Pierce , the storm knocked down power and telegraph lines . In the latter city , high waves washed out a portion of the causeway . In the 1980s , an elderly resident recalled that the storm was the most severe on record in Fort Pierce . damage was worst along the Indian River; several farms in Stuart experienced total losses , and, 16 % of the citrus crop , or 4 million boxes , were destroyed . Many chickenin Stuart were destroyed , and the local chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as. Across southeastern Florida , the hurricane damaged 6 houses and destroyed another, causing over $ 3 million in damage . One person , an African American farm worker , was killed when hisblew down in Gomez , adied after seven , and a child was killed by airborne debris .High rainfall caused flooding across Florida , notably near Tampa where waters reached 9 ft  deep . High rainfall of over 7 in  caused a dam operated by Tampa Electric Co. to break 3 mi  northeast of Tampa along theRiver . The break resulted in severe local damage , flooding portions ofSprings . Workers attempted to save the dam with, and after the break , most residents in the area were warned of the approaching flood . Over 50 homes were flooded , forcing about 150 people to evacuate . Outside Florida , the storm produced winds of 48 and 51 mph  in Savannah , Georgia and Charleston , South Carolina , respectively . In the latter city , the storm spawned a tornado , which caused about $ 10000 in property damage . Heavy rainfall occurred along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts , reaching over 12 in  . Light rainfall also extended into North Carolina .In the Bahamas after the storm , a boat sailed from Nassau to deliver food and building materials to.After the storm , the National Guard offered shelters for at least 400 homeless residents in Stuart . Of the 7900 families adversely affected by the hurricane , 4325 required assistance from the American Red Cross .in Texas , also affected by a major hurricane , requestedin Florida wait 15 days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell . The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from theRiver being pumped into the city 's water treatment plant , and a new dam was eventually built in 1944 . The Second Battle of was an engagement between United Nations  and North Korean  forces early in the Korean War from September 1 to September 15 , 1950 , along theRiver in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States  and Republic of Korea  troops repelled a strong North Korean attack .After the First Battle of , the US Army 's 2nd Infantry Division was moved to defend theRiver line . The division , which wasin combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People 's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division 's line . The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half , and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to, promoting a fight there .The urgency of the threat to Pusan Perimeter prompted the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to be brought in to reinforce the US Army troops . In two weeks of heavy fighting , the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the region . The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at, which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army .From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a doubleof both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in, often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army .When the North Koreans approached the Pusan Perimeter on August 5 , they attempted the same frontal assault technique on the four main avenues of approach into the perimeter . Throughout August , the6th Division , and later the7th Division engaged the US 25th Infantry Division at the Battle of, initiallya UN counteroffensive beforewith battles atand Battle Mountain . These attacks stalled as UN forces , well equipped and with plenty of reserves , repeatedly repelled North Korean attacks . North of, the4th Division and the US 24th Infantry Divisionin the area . In the First Battle of , the North Korean division was unable to hold its bridgehead across the river as large numbers of US reserve forces were brought in to repel it , and on August 19 , the4th Division was forced back across the river with 50 percent casualties . In theregion , five North Korean divisions were repulsed by three UN divisions in several attempts to attack the city during the Battle of. Particularly heavy fighting took place at the Battle of the where the13th Division was almost completely destroyed in the attack . On the east coast , three more North Korean divisions were repulsed by the South Koreans at P 'ohangdong during the Battle of P 'ohangdong . All along the front , the North Korean troops werefrom these defeats , the first time in the war their strategies were not working .In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle .by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surroundand destroy the UN and ROK units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to.On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five attack against the UN lines . These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back . Five battle groupings were ordered . The center attack called for the9th Division ,4th Division ,2nd Division , and10th Division break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the toand.During the North Koreans ' September 1 offensive , the US 25th Infantry Division 's US 35th Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle ofRiver north of. On the 35th Regiment 's right flank , just north of the confluence of theRiver and theRiver , was the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division . There , in the southernmost part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone , the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than 20000 yards  long , including thearea of thewhere the First Battle of had taken place earlier in August . Each US infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3000 feet  to 4000 feet  and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front .During the last week of August , US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river , which they thought was North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of theagainst a possible American attack . There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry 's forward positions , but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action . On August 31 , the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines . Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming .On the west side of the, North Korean Major General Sam , commanding the9th Division , issued his operations order to the division on August 28 . Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at by capturing theandareas to cut off the US 2nd Division 's route of supply and withdrawal betweenand Pusan . However , the North Koreans weren 't aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along theRiver . Consequently , they expected lighter resistance ; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea . They had only recently been moved into the line . The North Koreans began crossing theRiver under cover of darkness at certain points .On the southernmost flank of the 9th Infantry river line , just above the junction of theRiver with the, A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long finger ridgethethat terminates in Hill 94 at theferry site . The river road from ri running west along thepasses the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry . A small village calledlay at the base of Hill 94 and 300 yards  from the river . A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company , 9th Infantry , held a roadblock near the ferry and close to. On the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlookingand the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line .That evening Sergeant Ernest R.led the patrol of two tanks and twoGun Motorin.placed his patrol on the west side ofnear theferry . At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling on the Americanheld side of the river . By 22 : 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company 's positions . American mortars and artillery began firing. Some of the A Company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water .At 22 : 30 the fog lifted andsaw that a North Koreanbridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position .'s four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed , and theboats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks . This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise . 's patrol was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms .was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held thesite until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank . In the attack against A Company , the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon , which was near, but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward .The9th Division 's infantry crossing of theand attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company , north of A Company . There the North Koreans assaulted in force , signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles . The company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape . Many of the men moved south , a few of them coming into A Company 's ridge line positions nearduring the night . Most of C Company moved all the way to the 25th Division positions south of the. On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines .Meanwhile , 5 miles  north ofand A Company 's position , B Company , 9th Infantry , held a similar position on Hilloverlooking theferry crossing of the river . This ferry was located at the middle of the where theroad came down to theand crossed it . The US 2nd Infantry Division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of August 31 , the same night that theI Corps offensive rolled across the river .Near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th Infantry had crossed to the west side of theand observed North Korean tank and troop activity 2 miles  west of the river . Information obtained later indicated it was in fact the command post of the9th Division . On August 25 , 9th Infantry commander Colonel John G. Hill outlined projected " Operation, " which was to be a companysized combat patrol to cross the river , advance to the suspected North Korean command post and communications center , destroy it , capture prisoners , and collect intelligence .The 9th Infantry Regiment had planned Task Forceon orders from the 2nd Division commander Major General Laurence B., which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrolling .decided the patrol should cross the river at theferry . The 9th Infantry reserve , E Company , reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company , was to be the attack force . The 1st Platoon , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31 . Two heavy weapons companies , D and H , were each toone section of heavy machine guns , one section of 81 mortars , and one section of 75 recoilless rifles for supporting fires . A platoon of 42inch mortars was also to give support .After dark on August 31 , First Lieutenant Charles I. Caldwell of D Company and First Lieutenant Edwardof H Company , 9th Infantry , moved their men and weapons to the base of Hill, which was within B Company 's defense sector and overlooked theferry crossing of theRiver . The raiding force , E Company , was still in its regimental reserve position about 2 miles  west of, getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site . Colonel Hill went forward in the evening with the 42inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of Hillwhere theprepared to set up their weapons .By 21 : 00 , the closest front line unit was B Company on top of Hill, 1 mile  north of the river road which curved around the hill 's southern base . The regimental, Captain Lewis B. Sheen , had gone forward in the afternoon to B Company to hold services . On top of Hill,Sheen and men in B Company after dark heardin the water below them . They soon discovered a long line of North Korean soldiers wading the river .The first North Korean crossing at theferry caught the HeavyPlatoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons . It also caught most of the D and H Company men at the base of Hill,miles  from the crossing site . The North Koreans killed or captured many of the troops there . Hill was there , but escaped to the rear just before midnight , together with several others , when the division canceled Operationbecause of the attacks . The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attackthe men below . Iton to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter . This group was not attacked during the night .From 21 : 30 until shortly after midnight the9th Division crossed theat a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line positions . Then , when the artillery barrage preparation lifted , the North Korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults . These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward . At each crossing site the North Koreans would overwhelm local UN defenders before buildingbridges for their vehicles and armor .At 02 : 00 , B Company was attacked . A truck stopped at the bottom of the hill , a whistle sounded , then came a shouted order , and North Korean soldiers started climbing the slope . The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311 , a rugged terrain feature a 15 miles  from the river and the North Koreans ' principal immediate objective . The North Koreans apparently were not aware of the Task Forcegroup lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night . But higher up on Hillthe North Koreans drove B Company from its position , inflicting very heavy casualties on it . Sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on 4 September .At 03 : 00 , 1 September , the 9th Infantry Regiment ordered its only reserve , E Company to move west along theRiver road and take a blocking position at the pass betweenHill andRidge , 3 miles  from the river and 6 miles  from. This was the critical terrain where so much heavy fighting had taken place in the first battle of the . Fighting began at the pass at 02 : 30 when an American medium tank of A Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , knocked out a T34 at, also called. E Company never reached its blocking position . A strong North Korean force surprised and delivered heavy automatic fire on it at 03 : 30 from positionsthe road east of the pass . The company suffered heavy casualties , including the company commander and's aide who had accompanied the force . With the critical parts ofHill andRidge , the best defensive terrain betweenand the river , the North Koreans controlled the high ground . The US 2nd Infantry Division now had to base its defense ofon relatively poor defensive terrain , the low hills at the western edge of the town .North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the, the US 23rd Infantry Regiment on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion of the US 38th Infantry Regiment , which in turn had only a few days before relieved the US 21st Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division . On August 1 , the 23rd Regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge . It took over a 16000 yards River front without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north . Colonel Paul L. Freeman , the regimental commander , deployed the 1st Battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast . The 1st Battalion , under US Lieutenant Colonel Claire E., Jr . ,the hills with platoons and squads . He placed the 2nd Battalion in a reserve position 8 miles  behind the 1st Battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector . On Augustthe 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector .Two roads ran through the regimental sector from theRiver to. The main road bent south along the east bank of the river toand then turned northeast to. A northern secondary road curved aroundand lakes , the largest of which was Lake Up, to. In effect , the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to.The 42 men of the 2nd Platoon , B Company , 23rd Infantry held outpost positions on seven hills covering a 2600 yards  front along the east bank of thenorth of. Across the river in the ricethey could see , in the afternoon of August 31 , two large groups of North Korean soldiers . Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them . Just before dark , the platoon saw a column of North Koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river . They immediately reported to the battalion command post . The artillery forward observer , who estimated the column at 2000 people , thought they were refugees . Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column , reducing its number . However the North Koreans continued their advance .At 21 : 00 the first shells of what proved to be a twohour North Korean artillery and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon . As the barrage rolled on , North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire . At 23 : 00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon , forcing it from the hill after a short fight . Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line .On the regimental left along the mainroad North Korean soldiers completely overran C Company by 0300 September 1 . Only seven men of C Company could be accounted for , and three days later , after all the stragglers and those cut off behind North Korean lines had come in , there were only 20 men in the company . As the North Korean attack developed during the night , 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force , less C Company , just north of Lake Upand the hills there covering the northern road into, 3 miles  east of the river and 5 miles  west of the town . B Company lost heavily in this action .When word of the disaster that had1st Battalion reached regimental headquarters , Freeman obtained the release of G and F Companies from 2nd Division reserve and sent the former to help 1st Battalion and the latter on the southern road towardand C Company . Major Lloyd K. Jenson , executive officer of the 2nd Battalion , accompanied F Company down theroad . This force was unable to reach C Company , but Jenson collected stragglers from it and seized high groundthis main approach tonearri above Lake, and went into a defensive position there . The US 2nd Division released E Company to the regiment and the next day it joined F Company to build up what became the main defensive position of theRegiment in front of. North Korean troops during the night passed around the right flank of 1st Battalion 's northern blocking position and reached the road three miles behind him near the division artillery positions . The 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Service Companies and otherregimental units finally stopped this penetration near the regimental command post 5 miles  northwest of.Before the morning of 1 September had passed , reports coming in to US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that North Koreans had penetrated to the northsouthroad and cut the division in two ; the 38th andInfantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south .decided that this situation made itto control and direct the divided division as two special forces . Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes , in command of the northern group . Haynes ' command post was 7 miles  north of. Task Force Haynes became operational at 10 : 20 , September 1 ., in thearea ,placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley , Assistant Division Commander , in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment , the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , most of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and otherunits of the division . This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley .All three regiments of the2nd Divisionthe 4th , 17th , and 6th , in line from north to southcrossed during the night to the east side of theRiver into the 23rd Regiment sector . The2nd Division , concentrated in thearea west of the river , had , in effect , attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance intoabove and below Lake Up. On August 31 , 1950 , Lake Upwas a large body of water although in most places very shallow .At dawn September 1 ,at 2nd Division headquarters in, 7 miles  east ofon theroad , felt his division was in the midst of a crisis . The massive North Korean attack had made deepeverywhere in the division sector except in the north in the zone of the 38th Infantry . The9th Division had effected majorof theat two principal points against the US 9th Infantry ; the2nd Division in the meantime had made three majoragainst the US 23rd Infantry ; and the10th Division had begun crossing more troops in the Hillarea near'ung in the US 38th Infantry sector . At 08 : 10telephoned Eighth Army headquarters and reported the heaviest and deepest North Koreanwere in the 9th Infantry sector . planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the North Korean progress and to locate US 2nd Infantry Division frontline units . Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken . Beginning at 09 : 30 and continuing throughout the rest of the day , the light aviation section of the division artillery located frontline units cut off by the North Koreans , and made fourteenof ammunition , food , water , and medical supplies . As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a hole 6 miles  wide and 8 miles  deep in the middle of the division line and made less severeelsewhere . The frontline battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states ofand some companies had virtually disappeared .hoped he could organize a defense along theroad east of theRiver , and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading toand Ch.At 09 : 00 Walker requested the US Air Force to make a maximum effort along theRiver from dong , just above the US 2nd Division boundary , southward and to a depth of 15 miles  west of the river . He wanted the Air Force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further North Korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the North Korean spearhead units . The Far East Command requested the US Navy to join in the air effort , and the US Seventh Fleet turned back from its strikes in theSeoul area andsouthward at full steam toward the southern battle front . Walker came to the US 2nd Division front at 12 : 00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs . He had already ordered ground reinforcements to thearea .During the morning of 1 September , Walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front ,in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves . Since midnight theI Corps had broken his Pusan Perimeter in two placesthe2nd and 9th Divisions in the US 2nd Division sector , and the7th Division and6th Division in the US 25th Division sector , below the junction of theandRivers . In the US 2nd Division sector North Korean troops were at the edge of, the gateway to the corridor leading 12 miles  eastward toand the main Pusan railroad and highway .Eighth Army had in reserve threeinfantry regiments and the 2battalion British 27th Infantry Brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line : The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at, 6 miles  northeast of, preparing for movement to the port of Pusan ; the US 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division which had arrived atonly the night before at 20 : 30 to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team , which was then to join the 24th Division in thearea ; and the US 19th Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division , then with that division 's headquarters atsoutheast of. Walker alerted both the 24th Division headquarters , together with its 19th Regiment , and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to move at a moment 's notice ; the 24th Division either to the 2nd or 25th Division fronts , and the marines to andestination .As the morning passed , General Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the area of the US 2nd Division sector . There the North Koreans threatenedand with it the entire Eighth Army position . At 11 : 00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward A. Craig , commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the marines to move at once . The marines made ready to depart for the at 13 : 30 .The situation on the front was chaotic during the day September 1 . The North Koreans at one place had crossed at theferry , captured, and scattered A Company , 9th Infantry at its positions fromnorthward . A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river . From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them , most of them moving east . After several hours , 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill toto obtain supplies abandoned there during the night , returning later with much needed water , rations , and ammunition .Later in the morning North Korean barges crossed thebelow A Company . The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlookingto take these troops under fire . When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base . The company hit these houses with artillery . The North Koreans broke from the houses , running for the river . At this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire , as did another across theto the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector . artillery fire decimated this group . Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force . In the afternoon , US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company ; only part of it was recovered . The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night .During the withdraw , however , A Company ran into a sizable North Korean force and had scattered in the ensuing fight . Most of the company , including its commander were killed at close range . In this desperate action , Private First Class Luther H. Story , a weapons squad leader , fought sothat he was awarded the Medal of Honor .wounded , Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape , and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range . Of those in the company , approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines . The next morning , under heavy fog , the group made its way bytoward. From a hill at 12 : 00 , after the fog had lifted , the men looked down on the Battle ofwhich was then in progress . That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near.from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well .In the meantime , Task Forcewas still holding its position along theRiver , about 5 miles  north of where A Company had been destroyed on the southern end of the line . The perimeter position taken by the men of D and H Companies , 9th Infantry , who had started up the hill before the North Koreans struck , was on a southernof Hill, 05 miles  south of B Company 's higher position . In addition to the D and H Company men , there were a few from the HeavyPlatoon and one or two from B Company ., 60 to 70 men were in the group . The group had an 300 radio , a heavy machine gun , two light machine gun , aRifle , about 20 rifles , and about 40or pistols .assumed command of the group .During the nightestablished radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry . When daylight cameand his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans . One force occupied the higherhalf a mile above them , formerly held by B Company . Below them , North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some of them already several miles eastward . The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Forcegroup . They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed . That night an estimated company attacked three times , pressing the fight to close quarters , but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter .of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter .In the afternoon of September 2 1st Battalion for anof supplies . A US plane attempted the drop , but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands . The men in the perimeter did , however , recover from a drop made later at 19 : 00 some supplies and ammunition . Private First Class Joseph R., of H Company , left the perimeter to gather weapons , ammunition , and grenades from the North Korean dead . On several occasions he was attacked , and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked, who killed the North Korean in handtohand combat .That same afternoon , the North Koreans sent an American prisoner up the hill towith the message , " You have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces . "in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . Only 45 minutes later North Koreanfire came in on theand two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hillswept the perimeter . Soon , mortarson a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on's perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his. The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man .The third day , September 3 , the situation worsened . The weather was hot and ammunition , food and supplies were nearly completely exhausted . Since the previous afternoon , North Korean mortarhad alternated with infantry assaults against the perimeter .later estimated there were about twenty separate infantry attacks repulsed . Two North Korean machine guns still swept the perimeter whenever anyone showed himself . Dead and dying US troops were in almost every.fragments destroyed the radio and this ended all communication with other US units . Artillery fire and air strikes requested bynever came . Some North Koreans worked their way close to the perimeter and threw grenades into it . Six times from histo escape grenades thrown into it . In this close actionwas killed . Most of theof the perimeter received one or more direct mortar hits in the course of the continuing mortar fire . One of these killedon September 3 . The command passed now to First Lieutenant Raymond J.of D Company , senior surviving officer .At daylight on the morning of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill , were alive . As the day passed , with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight ,decided to abandon the position that night . When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 ,and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins , still alive in hiscondition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . He asked only that hisbe loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin . Like, he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions . Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many of them following thedownstream , hiding by day and traveling by night , until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division .Members of Task Forcewho escaped from Hillbrought back considerable intelligence information of North Korean activity in the vicinity of theferry crossing site . At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge . A short distance downstream , each night they placed abridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning .parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night , an estimated total of 8001000 carriers being used at this crossing site .North of the US 9th Infantry and the battles in the and around, the USInfantry Regiment after daylight of September 1 was in a very precarious position . Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 miles  westward . Approximately 400 North Koreans now overran the regimental command post , compelling Freeman to withdraw it about 600 yards  . There , 5 miles  northwest of, the US 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Headquarters Company ,regimental units , and regimental staff officers checked the North Koreans in a 3hour fight .The North Koreans advanced toitself during the afternoon of September 2 , and ROK National Police withdrew from the town . North Koreans were inthat evening . With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry , Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down theroad in an effort to reestablish communication . C Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , led its tanks southward . They had to fight their way down the road through several roadblocks . Of the three tanks that started , only the lead tank got through to. There , it delivered anof Task Force Haynes ' positions to Bradley .Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active . After the North Korean breakthrough during the night of August 31 ,had ordered the 2nd Battalion , 38th Infantry , to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of. In attempting to do this , the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road . They had penetrated to Hilloverlooking the 38th Infantry command post . This hill and Hilldominated the rear areas of the regiment . At 06 : 00 September 3 , 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hillagainst the 38th Regiment command post . The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other . But the Air Force did deliver rocket andstrikes .This fight continued until September 5 . On that day F Company captured Hillkilling 150 North Koreans . From the crest he and his men watched as many more North Koreans ran into a village below them . Directed artillery fire destroyed the village . Among the abandoned North Korean materiel on the hill ,'s men found twentyfive Americanandguns , a large American radio , thirty boxes ofAmerican fragmentation and concussion grenades , and some American rations .Meanwhile , during these actions in its rear , the 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , was cut off 3 miles  west of the nearest friendly units . On September 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to thearea . At 14 : 00 a tankinfantry patrol was sent down the road , but it reported that an estimated North Korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion 's defense perimeter . Upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to obstruct the movement of North Korean reinforcements and supplies . That evening Freeman approved this request , and 1st Battalion spent three days in the isolated positions . During this time C47planes supplied the battalion by.On the morning of September 1 , 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post nearto open the road to the 1st Battalion . On the second day of the fighting at the pass , the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire . The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17 : 00 September 2 . That evening , North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry , on Hillnorth of the road and opposite 1st Battalion , driving one company from its position .On September 4 , Haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments , giving the northern part of the 23rd 's sector to the 38th Infantry , thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to. The 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , about 1100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men . The 23rd Infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on theroad . The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion . At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position . In this regimental perimeter , the 23rd Infantry fought a series of hard battles . Simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating North Koreans fromand from its supply road .On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the9th Division , in their first offensive of the war , stood only a few miles short ofafter a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line . The 3rd Regiment had been left at , but division commander Major General Sam felt the chances of capturingwere strong .On the morning of September 1 , with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand , the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend.in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment . The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched aroundon the northwest .A Company , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , moved to the south side of theRiver road ; D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road . Approximately 2 miles  west ofan estimated 300 North Korean troops engaged A Company in a fire fight .Gun Motorof the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action , which lasted several hours . Meanwhile , with the approval of General Bradley , D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking. A platoon of infantry went into position behind it . A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge ofon the left flank of D Company . There , A Company went into position along the road ; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion , and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company . The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town . The road tocame south out of, bent around the western tip of this mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base . In its position , D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit , the road to.North Koreans had also approachedfrom the south . The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in a sharp fight . In this action , Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself . He mounted a tank , operated its exposed turret machine gun , and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns . Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank 'sandand scored more than 50 hits on it . Turner , although wounded , remained on the tank until he was killed . That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground aroundand entered the town from the south .At 09 : 35 September 2 , while the North Koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge ofand clear the road to, Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O., Deputy Chief of Staff , Far East Command in Tokyo . He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions . He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them . He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade towardbut had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them , since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command . Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them .replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary . A few hours after this conversation Walker , at 13 : 15 , attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a coordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines , with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of theRiver in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line . The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished .A decision was reached that the marines would attack west at 08 : 00 on September 3theRiver road ; the 9th Infantry , B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and D Battery of theAAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to reestablish contact with the US 23rd Infantry ; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , remnants of the 1st Battalion , 9th Infantry , and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank , or south , of the marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division . Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan area , 8 miles  south ofand 15 miles  east of the confluence of theRiver and theRiver . There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone .The American counteroffensive of September 3 – 5 west of, according to prisoner statements , resulted in one of the of the war for a North Korean division . Even though remnants of the9th Division , supported by the low strength4th Division , still heldRidge ,Hill , and the intervening ground back to theon September 6 , the division 's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack . The9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive .The2nd Division made a new effort against the 23rd Infantry 's perimeter in thehours of September 8 , in an attempt to break through eastward . This attack , launched at 02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery , penetrated F Company . It was apparent that unless F Company 's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse . When all its officers became casualties , First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson , adjutant of the 2nd Battalion , assumed command of the company . With North Koreans rapidly infiltrating his company 's position and gaining its rear , Robinson in the darkness made his way through them 500 yards  to A Company 's position . There he obtained that company 's reserve platoon and brought it back to F Company . He accomplished the dangerous and difficult task ofit into the gap in F Company 's lines in darkness and heavy rain .The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight , but that night it resumed . The North Koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line . This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September . The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops . Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning . All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points . At one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men . When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent .This heavy night and day battle cost the2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength . The medical officer of the17th Regiment , 2nd Division , captured a few days later , said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in, and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1300 killed and 2500 wounded in the fighting west of. Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9 , the division continued to harass rear areas aroundwith infiltrating groups as large as companies .daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town .North Korean and US troops remained locked in combat along theRiver for several more days . The North Koreans ' offensive capability was largely destroyed , and the US troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack .The UN counterattack atcollapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes . On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night , and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them . Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea . The North Koreans withdrew from thearea first , the night of September 18 – 19 . After the forces there , the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North . The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over theRiver positions , which were no longer of strategic importance .The North Korean 2nd and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles . The 9th Division had numbered 9350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1 . The 2nd Division numbered 6000 . Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the fight . The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed , captured or deserted . All ofII Corps was in a similar state , and the North Korean army , exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after, was on the brink of defeat .By this time , the US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1120 killed , 2 wounded , 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter . This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of the previous month . American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter . The division had numbered 17 on September 1 , but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties . The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , most of which probably occurred at.Of all the North Korean attacks along the Pusan Perimeter , the Second Battle of is seen by historians as the most serious threat . It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most substantial gains , splitting the US 2nd Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing, where they were very close to breaching through to the US forces ' supply lines and threatening other divisions ' rear areas . However , once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable ofa breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points . By September 8 , the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed . , also known as  Planet Earth and stylized as , is an American rock band from Huntington Beach , California .

An ironclad is a steampropelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century . The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armoredin 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an allarmored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads  took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced theship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War . were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and longrange cruisers . The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steelbuilt ,battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century . This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns  , more sophisticated steam engines , and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible .The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of flux . Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat . There is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use . New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers .The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century . According to naval historian J. Richard Hill : " The  had three chief characteristics : a metalskinned hull , steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells . It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad . " Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads .In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate . The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion . Whilesteamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards , steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s .Steampowered screw frigates were built in the mid1840s , and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle . The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe , which required a challenge to the British at sea . The first purposebuilt steam battleship was the 90gun Napoléon in 1850 . Napoléon was armed as a conventional shipoftheline , but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots  , regardless of the wind conditions : a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement .The introduction of the steam shipoftheline led to a building competition between France and Britain . Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France over a period of ten years , but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production ., France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line , while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41 .The era of the wooden steam shipoftheline was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns . In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24pounder guns with 32pounders on sailing shipsoftheline and introducing 68pounders on. Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the FrenchHenriJoseph, and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of, spelled the end of the wooden warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing redhot shot , which couldin the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power .The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships ' hulls began in the 1830s ; the first " warship " with an iron hull was the gunboat, built by Laird for the East India Company in 1839 . There followed , also from Laird , the first fullblown warships with metal hulls , the 1842 steam frigatesandfor the Mexican navy . But a thin iron skin , while not being susceptible to fire or lethallike wood , was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire .Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of, and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to theguns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War , Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of lightdraft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor . Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory , and on 17 July 1854 , the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gunproof vessels and that plans would be communicated . After tests in September 1854 , the British Admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the French plans , establishing the important Thames andIron Works within the docks .The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War . The role of the battery was to assistmortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . The French used three of their ironclad batteries  in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle ofon the Black Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences . They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859 . The British floating batteriesand Meteor arrived too late to participate to the action at. The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the wellfortified naval base at.The batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only 4 knots  under their own power : they operated under their own power at the Battle of, but had to be towed for long range transit . They were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy . The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their.By the end of the 1850s it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships , and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required . The result was the first oceangoing ironclad , the Gloire , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859 .Gloire 's wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line , reduced to one deck ,in iron plates 45 inches  thick . She was propelled by a steam engine , driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots  . She was armed with thirtysix 64inch  rifled guns . France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more sister ships to Gloire , and the only two broadside ironclads ever built ,and.The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was determined that the first British ironclad wouldthe French ships in every respect , particularly speed . A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make herto enemy fire . The British specification was more a large , powerful frigate than a shipoftheline . The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron . The result was the construction of two Warriorclass ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince . The ships had a successful design , though there were necessarily compromises between ' seakeeping ' , strategic range and armour protection ; their weapons were more effective than that of Gloire , and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 143 knots  . Yet the Gloire and her sisters had full ironarmour protection along the waterline and the battery itself . Warrior and Black Prince  were obliged to concentrate their armour in a central ' citadel ' or ' armoured box ' , leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected . The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some drawbacks ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more susceptible toby marine life .By 1862 , navies across Europe had adopted ironclads . Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction , though the British vessels were larger . Austria , Italy , Russia , and Spain were also building ironclads . However , the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France , and involved ships markedly different from the broadsidefiring ,designs of Gloire and Warrior . The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War , and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of, had an important influence on the development of ironclad design .The first use of ironclads in action came in the U.S. Civil War . The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads , its most powerful ships being six steampoweredfrigates . Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union , the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships . In May 1861 , the Confederate Congress voted that $ 2 million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas , and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships .On 12 October 1861 , the CSSbecame the first ironclad to enter combat , when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the Battle of the Head of. She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting . In February 1862 , the larger CSS Virginia joined the Confederate Navy , having been rebuilt at Norfolk .on the hull of USS, Virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood , but she was converted into an ironcovered casemate ironclad, when she entered the Confederate navy . By this time , the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the City class , and was about to complete the USS, an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor John Ericsson . The Union was also building a large armored frigate , the USS New, and the smaller USS.The first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862 , as the armoredwas deployed to protect the Union 's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram Virginia and other Confederate warships . In this engagement , the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads , the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor . The battle attracted attention worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date , with the ironclads destroying them easily .The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides , and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside thewarships , commerce raiders and blockade runners . The Union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake . The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the Virginia , many of which saw action , but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy — especially in Russia , the only country to openly support the Union through the war . Only CSSwas completed , and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war .Through the remainder of the war , ironclads saw action in the Union 's attacks on Confederate ports . Seven Union monitors , including USS, as well as two other ironclads , the ironclad frigate Newand a lightdraft USS, participated in the failed attack on Charleston ; one was sunk . Two small ironclads , CSSState and CSSparticipated in the defence of the harbor . For the later attack at Mobile Bay , the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the CSS Tennessee , the Confederacy 's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats CSS Morgan , CSS Gaines , CSS Selma .On the western front , the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads , beginning with several convertedand then contracting engineer Jamesof St. Louis , Missouri to build the Cityclass ironclads . These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a centralwheel , all protected by an armored. They had a shallow draft , allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries , and were very well suited for river operations .also produced monitors for use on the rivers , the first two of which differed from the oceangoing monitors in that they contained awheel  .vessels were some of the better ironclads of the Western Flotilla , but there were a number of other vessels that servedwith the fleet . All were of varying design , some more successful than others , and some were similar to standardbut with armored sidemountedwheels . All were armed with various smoothbore and some rifled guns . If nothing else the experience of the American Civil War and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs , some more successful  than others , confirmed the emerging tradeoff or compromises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going on in Europe . There was no such thing as a ' perfect ' ironclad which could bein every possible encounter ; ship duels , standing up to forts , Brown & Bluewater operations .The Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts , installations and vessels with relativeto enemy fire . They were not as heavily armored as the oceangoing monitors of the Union , but they were adequate for their intended use . More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes  than by enemy fire , and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations , not Confederate vessels .The first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , involving ironclad warships was the Battle ofin 1866 .between the Austrian and Italian navies , the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates andand ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles ofand.The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships , escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of. Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates , four smaller ironclads , and the newly built— a double ram .them , the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates .The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy , so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them . The Austrian fleet formed into anformation with the ironclads in the first line , charging at the Italian ironclad squadron . In thewhich followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns , and by the difficulty of— nonetheless , the effectiveattack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years .The superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads , Re d 'Italia and Palestro , while the Austrianscrew two SMS Kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads . The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years , and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the Adriatic .The battles of the American Civil War and atwere very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed . In particular , it taught a generation of naval officers the misleading lesson thatwas the best way to sink enemy ironclads .The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless , since their shot would bounce off an armored hull . To penetrate armor , increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships ; nevertheless , the view thatwas the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread . The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside , in the manner of a shipoftheline , towards a handful of guns in turrets for allround fire .From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare . With steam power freeing ships from the wind , and armor making themto, the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow .Thedamage inflicted by the guns ofand Virginia at Battle of Hampton Roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max sinking the Italian Re d 'Italia atgave strength to thecraze . From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram . Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk bystruggled to be heard .The revival ofhad a significant effect on naval tactics . Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle , where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns . This tactic was totally unsuited to, and the ram threw fleet tactics into. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle , and if it had been , combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water .The ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo , with less vulnerability to quickfiring guns .The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range ; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration . Throughout the ironclad era navies alsowith theof rifled versus smoothbore guns and breechloading versus muzzleloading .HMS Warrior carried a mixture of 110pounder 7 inch  breechloading rifles and more traditional 68pounder smoothbore guns . Warrior highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament ; the breech she carried , designed by Sir William Armstrong , were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy , but were shortly withdrawn from service .loading guns seemed to offer important advantages . A breech could bewithout moving the gun , a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be reaimed . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and , because of their, more accurate . Nonetheless , the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech for decades .The weakness of the breech was the obvious problem of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas . This explosionthe shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but alsogreat stresses on the gunbarrel . If the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break . This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 45 in  armor of Gloire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing . Similar problems were experienced with the breechloading guns which became standard in the French and German navies .These problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzleloading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s . After a brief introduction of 100pounder or 95inch  smoothbore Somerset Gun , which weighed 65 tons  , the Admiralty introduced 7inch  rifled guns , weighing 7 tons . These were followed by a series of increasinglyweapons — guns weighing 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre increasing from 8inch  to 16inch  .The decision to retain muzzle until the 1880s has been criticised by historians . However , at least until the late 1870s , the British muzzle had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech , which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns .From 1875 onwards , the balance betweenand muzzleloading changed . Captain deinvented a method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as, the growing size of naval guns made muzzleloading much more complicated . With guns of such size there was no prospect ofin the gun for reloading , or even reloading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required for reloading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire . In 1882 , the 81ton , 16inch  guns of HMSfired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding Alexandria during the . The 100ton , 450 mm  guns of could each fire a round every 15 minutes .In the Royal Navy , the switch to breech was finally made in 1879 ; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance , opinion wasby an explosion on board HMScaused by a gun being doubleloaded , a problem which could only happen with a muzzleloading gun .The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull , and the less the stability of the ship . The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviestof gun ever used at sea . HMScarried two 1625inch  breechloading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as large . The Italian 450 mm  guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 181inch  armament of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II . One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weaponsplatform ' couldthe advantage of. American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least '' along the surface of the water .effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of— though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds . Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem . As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns .Another method of increasing firepower was to vary thefired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . Theof the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into, allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder whichmore slowly again . It also put less stress on theof the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to .The development ofpowder , based onor, by the French inventor Paulin 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels . The guns of the pre battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in  , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improvedto gain greater muzzle velocity .The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period . Initially , the best armorpiercingwas a solid castiron shot . Later , shot ofiron , a harder iron alloy , gave better armorpiercing qualities . Eventually the armorpiercing shell was developed .The first British , French and Russian ironclads , in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line , carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called " broadside ironclads . " Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were examples of this type . Because their armor was so heavy , they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck .A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , principally in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States . The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than oneat a time , and the rigging did not impede the field of fire . armament also had disadvantages , which became more serious as ironclad technology developed .guns to penetrate everthicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried . Furthermore , the adoption ofas an important tactic meant the need for ahead and allround fire . These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater allround fire , which included centralbattery , turret , and barbette designs .There were two main designto the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' boxbattery ' or ' centrebattery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or, a barbette .The centrebattery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method .guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter andthan a broadside type . The first fullscale centrebattery ship was HMS Bellerophon of 1865 ; the French laid down centrebattery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870 . Centrebattery ships often , but not always , had a enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead .The turret was first used in naval combat on the USSin 1862 , with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer John Ericsson . A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor with a prototype of this installed on HMSin 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes . Ericsson 's turret turned on a central spindle , and's turned on a ring of bearings .offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns , but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s . The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging , so they were unsuited to use on the earlier oceangoing ironclads . The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy . Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret  by deliberately designing a ship with very low. The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armour . Low, however , also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage — and therefore range of the vessel . In many respects , the, lowand the broadsideHMS Warrior represented two opposite extremes in what an '' was all about . The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes , or 'this circle ' , was designed by Captain: HMS Captain , a dangerously lowturret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail , and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870 . Her halfsister HMS Monarch was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams . The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was HMSof 1876 , which carried two turrets on either side of the centreline , allowing both to fire fore , aft and broadside .A lighter alternative to the turret , particularly popular with the French navy , was the barbette . These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a. The crew was sheltered from direct fire , but vulnerable tofire , for instance from shore emplacements . The barbette was lighter than the turret , needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the topweight of their ships . The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s , and with the addition of an armored ' gunhouse ' , transformed into the turrets of the pre battleships .The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helpedthe design and tactics of ironclad fleets . The first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relativeofagainst ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously . The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to becomearmored spartorpedo vessels while under construction in 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action . Another proposal , the towed or ' Harvey ' torpedo , involved an explosive on a line or; either to deter a ship fromor to make a torpedo attack by a boat less.A more practical and influential weapon was the selfpropelled or Whitehead torpedo .in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s , the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMSand the Italian and Enrico. The ironclad 's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo . In practice , however , the was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads .The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls , and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden.were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s .Using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull . However ,iron had many military disadvantages , and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years , particularly for longrange cruising warships .Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s . In the 1830s and 1840s , France , Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron butgunboats and frigates . However , the iron frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s , because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot ; iron was more brittle than wood , and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood .Theofiron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor . However , iron gave the naval architect many advantages . Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design , for instance the use ofbulkheads on the lower decks . Warrior , built of iron , was longer and faster than the wooden Gloire . Iron could be produced to order and used immediately , in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of. And , given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were increasingly costeffective . The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough , and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought .Wooden hulls continued to be used for longrange and smaller ironclads , because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage . Iron hulls suffered quickby marine life , slowing the ships down —for a Europeanclose to dry docks , but a difficulty for longrange ships . The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper , a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive . Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable : the Japaneseandordered in 1875 were sisterships , but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction .After 1872 , steel started to be introduced as a material for construction . Compared to iron , steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight . The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet , starting with the, laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 .nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate , and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel .Even though Britain led the world in steel production , the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships . Theprocess for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for largescale use on ships . French manufacturers used the Martin process to produce adequate steel , but British technologybehind . The first allsteel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vesselsand Mercury , laid down in 1875 and 1876 .Ironbuilt ships used wood as part of their protection scheme . HMS Warrior was protected by 45 in  of wrought iron backed by 15 in  of, the strongest shipbuilding wood . The wood played two roles , preventingand also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship . Later , wood and iron were combined in ' sandwich ' armor , for instance in HMS.Steel was also an obvious material for armor . It was tested in the 1860s , but the steel of the time was too brittle andwhen struck by shells . Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form of compound armor . This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor  and then for all armor  . The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately , with licenses being given for the use of the ' Wilson System ' of producing fused armor .The first ironclads to have allsteel armor were the Italian and Enrico. Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877 . The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet , but found it limited in supply , so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor . Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889 .The ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickelsteel . In 1890 , the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the Harvey process and found it superior to compound armor . For several years ' Harvey steel ' was the state of the art , produced in the U.S. , France , Germany , Britain , Austria and Italy . In 1894 , the German firmdeveloped gas, which further hardened steel armor . The German Kaiser Friedrich III , laid down in 1895 , was the first ship to benefit from the new 'armor ' and the new armor was quickly adopted ; the Royal Navy using it from HMS Canopus , laid down in 1896 . By 1901 almost all new battleships usedarmor , though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade .The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in  of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in  of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor , and to 775 in  of Harvey armor or 575 in  ofarmor . construction alsothe later debate in battleship design betweenand ' allornothing ' armour design . Warrior was only semiarmoured , and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern . As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns , the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished .'s armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships , protecting boilers and engines , turrets and magazines , and little else . An ingenious arrangement of filled compartments andbulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her unarmored sections .The first oceangoing ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors , and these features were only gradually abandoned . Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry " 5 to 9 days coal " , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads . Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail  , and afunnel which could be folded down to the deck level .Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the, or USSand her sisters ,with masts from the beginning . The British HMS, started in 1869 , was the first large , oceangoing ironclad towith masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean . Theand the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on shortrange operations in the Adriatic , built consistentlyironclads .During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of doubleexpansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the doubleexpansion engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steamonly fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as significantly , because ofproblems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of doubleexpansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory .During the 1870s the distinction grew between ' firstclass ironclads ' or ' battleships ' on the one hand , and ' cruising ironclads ' designed for longrange work on the other . The demands on firstclass ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement , which reduced speed under sail ; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly. HMS, launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881 , was the last British battleship to carry masts , and these were widely seen as a mistake . The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships . persisted on ' cruising ironclads ' for much longer . During the 1860s , the French navy had produced the Alma and Laclasses as small , longrange ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like HMSof 1870 . The Russian ship GeneralAdmiral , laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875 , was a model of a fast , longrange ironclad which was likely to be able toandships like. Even the later HMS Shannon , often described as the first British armored cruiser , would have been too slow toGeneralAdmiral . While Shannon was the last British ship with a retractable, later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig ,speed under steam in consequence . It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a longrange armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders , HMS Warspite , which was completed in 1888 . While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s , rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century .The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the tripleexpansion steam engine , a further refinement which was first adopted in HMS Sans Pareil , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891 . Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid1900s  .While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide , there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads . Most European nations settled differences on land , and the Royal Navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France , while providing suitable protection to Britain 's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide .remained , for the British Royal Navy , a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second . Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19thcentury which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between secondrate naval powers . But these encounters were often enough to convince British policymakers of the increasingof strictly naval foreign intervention , from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to thecombined defences of navalsuch asand Cherbourg .There were many types of ironclads : ships intended to " stand in the line of battle " ; the precursors of the battleship .Coastal service andvessels , including ' floating batteries ' and 'intended for commerce raiding or protection of commerce , called ' armoured The United Kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world for the whole of the ironclad period . The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships , and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles . In the age of sail , the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy . Because of the limited endurance of, this was no longer possible , so the British at times considered the riskladen plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out . To this end , the Royal Navy developed a series of ' coastdefence battleships ' , starting with theclass . These 'monitors ' were markedly different from the other highseas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship . As longrange monitors they could reach Bermuda, for example . However , they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions  as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War . The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment ofby the close of the Crimean War , but never considered running the smokeridden , shallowwater gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads . Likewise , monitors provedunable to ' overwhelm ' enemy fortifications singlehanded during the American conflict , though their lowprofile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running.and obstructions , however , negated these advantages — a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period . The British never laid down enough class ' battleships ' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg ,or even New York City with gunfire . Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals , by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act , which promulgated the idea of a ' twopower standard ' , that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined . This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s .British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period . The Royal Navy 's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or onesided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 .British interests against Ahmed ''s Egyptian revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria . A mixture of centrebattery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing the Egyptians to retreat ; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five British sailors . Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted , on the other hand , and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact . Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal , they might have quickly turned the tide , for the attacking British ironclads found it easy  to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets for highangle fire upon their thinly armoured.The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British , but were consistently outbuilt by the British . Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breechloading weapons and steel construction , the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy . In the 1870s , the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the school of naval thought took prominence , suggesting that torpedo boats andcruisers would be the future of warships . Like the British , the French navy saw little action with its ironclads ; the French blockade of Germany in the FrancoPrussian War was ineffective , as the war was settled entirely on land .Russia built a number of ironclads , generally copies of British or French designs . Nonetheless , there were real innovations from Russia ; the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser , the GeneralAdmiral of the 1870s , and a set of remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as ''  . The Russian Navy pioneered the widescale use of torpedo boats during the RussoTurkish War of 1877 – 1878 , mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy . Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships , but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership , which enhanced their defeat in the Battle ofon 27 May 1905 .The U.S. Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty monitortype coastal ironclads ; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve , leaving the USA virtually without an ironclad fleet . Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s . The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas , and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers . The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the Great White Fleet , and it was the modern pre and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish – American War of 1898 . This started a new era of naval warfare . were widely used in South America . Both sides used ironclads in theIslands War between Spain and the combined forces of Peru and Chile in the early 1860s . The powerful Spanishparticipated in the Battle ofbut was unable to inflict significant damage to thedefences . Besides , Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War designs , the and the Victoria  , as well as two Britishbuilt ironclads :, a centrebattery ship , and the turret ship.was the first ironclad tothe world , arriving inon 20 September 1867 , and earning the motto : " " [ " First ironclad ship to sail around the world " ] ) . In the War of the Pacific in 1879 , both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships , including some of those used a few years previously against Spain . While theran aground early on , the Peruvian ironclad 'made a great impact against Chilean shipping , delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months . She was eventually caught by two more modern Chilean centrebattery ironclads , the and the at the Battle ofPoint . were also used from the inception of the Imperial Japanese Navy . The had a decisive role in the Naval Battle ofBay in May 1869 , which marked the end of theWar , and the complete establishment of theRestoration . Thecontinued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards , first ironclads and later armored cruisers . These ships engaged the Chinesefleet which was superior on paper at least at the Battle of theRiver .to superior shortrange firepower , the Japanese fleet came off better , sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four . The naval war was concluded the next year at the Battle of, where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were surrendered to the Japanese .There is no clearly defined end to the ironclad , besides the transition from wood hulls to allmetal .continued to be used in World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century , the descriptions ' battleship ' and ' armored cruiser ' came to replace the term ' ironclad ' .The proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships , producing the type known as the pre . These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship . The next evolution of battleship design , the dreadnought , is never referred to as an ' ironclad ' .Most of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the 1900s  . For instance , a handful of US navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I. Pre battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in World War I and in some cases through to World War II .The example of the ironclads had some bearing on the history of the tank , as ironclad warships became an inspiration for ideas ofand other armored vehicles . H. G. Wells , in his short story The Land, published in The Strand Magazine in December 1903 , described the use of large , armoured crosscountry vehicles , armed with cannon and machine guns , and equipped withwheelsA number of ironclads have been preserved or reconstructed as museum ships .Parts of USShave been recovered and are beingand displayed at the Mariners ' Museum in Newport News , VirginiaHMS Warrior is today a fully restored museum ship in Portsmouth , England is berthed at the port of, Chile , on display for visitors .The Cityclass ironclad USS Cairo is currently on display in, Mississippi .in Newport News constructed a fullscale replica of USS.

Littleis the fourth and final poem of T. S. Eliot 's Four, a series of poems that discuss time , perspective , humanity , and salvation . It was first published in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the airraids on Great Britain during World War II and Eliot 's declining health . The title refers to a small Anglican community in, established by Nicholasin the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War .The poem uses the combined image of fire andfire to emphasise the need for purification and. According to the poet , humanity 's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare , but this can be overcome bythe lessons of the past . Within the poem , the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures . Littlefocuses on the unity of past , present , and future , and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation .Following the completion of the third Fourpoem , The Dry, Eliot 's health declined and he stayed inGreen , Surrey while he recovered . During this time , Eliot started writing Little. The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it . He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write , and that , precipitated by air raids on London , he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly . After the first draft was written , he set the poem aside , and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain .After months of not working on the poem , Eliot began to feel compelled to finish it ; it was not until August 1942 , however , that he started working on it again . In total , there were five drafts . The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly . Littlewas intended to conclude the Fourseries ,Eliot 's views expressed in this series of poems .Littlewas the home of an Anglican community established inby Nicholas. Thehousehold lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer . The religious community was dispersed during the English Civil War betweenandbut reformed , ending with the death of Johnin. Eliot had visited the site in May 1936 .Unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the Fourpoems , Eliot had no direct connection to the original Christian community . As such , the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community .Critics classify Littleas a poem of fire with an emphasis onand thefire . The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter , with attention paid to the arrival of summer . The images of snow , which provoke desires for a spiritual life , transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire , earth , air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four . Following this is a discussion on death and destruction , things, and regret for past events .While using Dante 's style , the poem continues by describing the Battle of Britain . The image of warfarewith the depiction of, and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the airraids on London . In the second section , a ghost , representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds , begins talking to the narrator of the poem . The ghost discusses change , art in general , and how humankind is flawed . The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity , according to the ghost , is to experiencethrough fire . The fire is described in a manner similar to Julian of Norwich 's writing about God 's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of, a shirt that burns its wearer . Littlecontinues by describing theof the present and how history exists in a pattern . The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn , and that salvation should be the goal of humankind .In terms of renewal , Eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin . The original Littlecommunity was built for living on monastic lines , but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646 . The church , the centre of the community , was restored in 1714 and again in 1853 . The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London airraids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world . This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit ,, communion with the dead , and the repetition of history . The theme is also internal to Eliot 's own poems ; the image of the rose garden at the end Littleis the image that beginsNorton and the journey is made circular . Also , the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family.Like the other poems making up the Four, Littledeals with the past , present , and future , and humanity 's place within them as each generation is seemingly united . In the second section , there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets , including Dante , Swift , Yeats , and others . When the ghost joins the poet , the narrator states " Knowing myself yet being someone other " . This suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge , allowing a communication and connection with the dead . Later , in the fourth section , humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London ; redemption or destruction . God 's love allows humankind to beand escape the living hell throughby fire . The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet . He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society .The ghost , a combination of many literary figures , was originally addressed in the poem as " " before being revised as an ambiguous " you " . " " was Dante 's way of addressing , a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been condemned for. Eliot , in a letter to Johndated 27 August 1942 , explained why he changed the wording :I think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid offor two reasons . The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that . However , I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want toto him the particular vice which tookthere ., although the reference to thatis intended to be explicit , I wish the effect of the whole to bewhich is more appropriate . That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of26 where the poets are found .The theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of , a poet that influenced Dante , seeking such a state in . However , the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing , an act that appears throughout Yeats 's poetry , withinflames . The critic Dominicsuggests that , in combining the image of dancing with, EliotDante 's and Yeats 's poetic themes .Critics such as Malcolmand describe mixed emotions about theof the poem .emphasised the mystical nature of the poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism thanwhile mentioning his appreciation of many of the passages .also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little. F. B.believed that the fourth section of the poem costs " Eliot more trouble andthan any passage of the same length he ever wrote , and is his greatest achievement in the Four. " E. M. Forster did not like Eliot 's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem : " Of course there 's pain on and off through each individual 's life ... You can 'tit and so on . But why should it be endorsed by the schoolmaster andby the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer . " Writing in 2003 , Rogerwrote that in " Little" Eliot achieved " that for which heDante — namely , a poetry of belief , in which belief and words are one , and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language " . The Portage to Sanofis a 1981 literary and philosophical novella by George Steiner , in which Jewish Nazi hunters find a fictional Adolf Hitler  alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after the end of World War II . The book generated considerable controversy after its publication because in it , Steiner , who is Jewish , allows Hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by his captors . There Hitler maintains that Israelits existence to the Holocaust and that he is the " benefactor of the Jews " .The Portage to Sanofwas a 1983in the/ Faulkner Award for Fiction . It was adapted for the theatre by British playwright Christopher Hampton and was staged in London in April 1982 with Alecplaying the part of Adolf Hitler . It was also staged in Hartford , Connecticut in the United States in 1983 and starred Johnas Hitler .From his base in Tel Aviv , Holocaust survivor Emmanueldirects a group of Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler .believes that the formeris still alive , and following rumours and, he tracks Hitler 's movements through South America , until after months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle , the search party finds the 90yearold alive in a clearing .flies to Sanwhere he awaits the group 's return with their captive . But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in , and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms .Meanwhile , broken and incoherent radio messages betweenand the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress , and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler 's capture .flare up over his impending trial , where it will be held and under whose jurisdiction .is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party , and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town . But when the search party loses radio contact with, they must make a decision : do they sit out the storms and deliver their captive tolater , or do they try Hitler in the jungle before their prize isfrom them by the world at large , who they know will be waiting ? Their decision is the latter , and against's advice  they prepare for a trial with a judge , prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party ., a local Indian, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness .The attention Hitler is receiving , however ,his strength , and when the trial begins , heaside his " defence attorney " and begins a long speech in four parts in his own defence :Firstly , Hitler claims he took his doctrines from the Jews and copied the notion of the master race from thepeople and their need to separate themselves from the "" .

Many of the ideas Steiner expresses in The Portage to Sanofwere reworked from these earlier works . Steiner told New York Times editor D. J. R.that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language . " Central to everything I am and believe and have written is my... that you can use human speech both to, to love , to build , to forgive and also to torture , to hate , to destroy and to. "Commenting on the controversy the book generated , Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron that he too was disturbed by it , adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him , "or like " . He said that it felt like the book " wrote me " . Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust , but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia , Vietnam , El Salvador and: " My feeling is that one has towith theif one can . "Steiner wrote The Portage to Sanofin 1975 and 1976 in Geneva , Switzerland , and the 120page work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the United States literary magazine , The Kenyon Review . It also appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of, the British literary magazine . Its first publication in book form , with minor revisions by Steiner , was in May 1981 byandin the United Kingdom — and as requested by Steiner , it was a paperback original . The first United States edition was published in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster .The Portage to Sanofwas adapted for the theatre in 1982 by British playwright Christopher Hampton . It was staged in April 1982 at London 'sTheatre under the direction of John Dexter with Alecplaying the part of Adolf Hitler .won the 1982 Evening Standard Theatre Award for best actor for this performance . In 1983 the production moved to the United States where it played at the Hartford Stage Company in Hartford , Connecticut , directed by Markand starring Johnas Hitler .This book is the only work of fiction by Steiner to have been adapted for the stage .Reaction to The Portage to Sanofwas mixed . Anthonyin The Observer called it " astonishing " , Christopher Booker of The Daily Telegraph described it as a " powerful piece " , and English author A. S.said it was a " masterpiece " . In Explaining Hitler , Roncalled The Portage " Astory " , referring to Steiner 'sHitler has having taken on a life of its own . Writing in Time magazine , Otto Friedrich described the book " afantasy of remarkable intensity " , adding that by notHitler 's speech , Steinerfrom theof traditional Holocaust literature and ends the book " on a note of bleak ambiguity " .Morrisof The New York Times was more critical of the book , calling it " aand badly executed novel , adistraction from the serious business of thinking through the of the Nazi era . " He described it as "" that is "[ d ] " by too much " fine writing "  . He also complained that the characters are lifeless , and while they each have detailed histories , they are only " verbal" that do not separate them from one another . Finallynoted that because almost all the points of Hitler 's speech are drawn from some of Steiner 's earlier works , he " unwittingly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet alsoand brilliant — at onceharmless anddangerous . "In another review in The New York Times John Leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points , " some wit , adisdain , multiplicity of character and a South American swamplife that" , its weaknesses are that " the characters are really ideas , ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books byand" . But Leonard 's biggest criticism of the book was Hitler 's speech , which he called " obscene " , and Steiner 's decision to end the book at that point , which Leonard said " not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend , but ... makes me sick to my stomach . "Writing in the American literary magazine, Alvin H.called The Portage a " breakthrough work " that "" . He was struck by the book 's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle , and the " landscape of speech " — the former being " brilliantly registered " with its " immense feeling of" , and the latter , " even more dramatic " in the way it exposes " the dark underside of words " and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person . He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanueland his role as representative of the Jewish consciousness .noted that while Holocaust literature often eitherto "and apostrophe " , or sinks to " a of elegiac lament " , Steiner 's"between these two extremes , ... simultaneously records and, yet carries an immense affect " . What did concern the reviewer , however , was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works , that he had put them " virtually" into Hitler 's mouth , creating the impression that " Steiner 's understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter 's selfunderstanding " .also questioned why the book had to end with Hitler 's speech . He said that Steiner 'sHitler plays " the devil 's game of language subversion " , making " madness [ sound ] like music " , something the real Hitler had. By stopping at this point ,felt that Steiner "[ s ] ,, to the seductiveof negation " , whichhis own " high standards of moral intelligence " . But overallsaid The Portage " must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of Hitler " , forcing us to confront him " in a way hardly seen before in fiction " .The Portage to Sanofwas ain the 1983/ Faulkner Award for Fiction .The book generated considerable controversy because of its apparent " admiration for Hitler " . The controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation  was performed in the United Kingdom and the United States .Hitler 's speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics . Steiner not only lets Hitler justify his past , he allows him the  last word before the outside world invades . The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious . One critic , while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitler as " the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil " , felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between Steiner 's own views and those of his fictional Hitler , even going so far as to accuse Steiner , who rejects Jewish nationalism and is a critic of Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians , of antiSemitism .In contrast , a Time magazine article at the time felt that Steiner 's intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief " that Hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force " , drawing attention to Nazi hunter Emmanuel's warning from the book regarding Hitler : " There shall come a man who ... will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others . He will know the sounds of madness andand make them seem music . "Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler 's speech in this book isby saying that it had been done before : for example Satan 's speech in Milton 's Paradise Lost  , and The Grand's speech in's The Brothers . He also reminded the reader that Hitler 's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by's long monologue on theof the Holocaust . Finally , Steiner said that his Hitler  is " afigure " , and that it is not he who has the last word , but, the Indian, who shouts "" .is also the Hebrew word used to indicate that " there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide . " and ) is a diverseof extinct small to giant— often considered primitive amphibians — that flourished worldwide during the,, andperiods . A few species continued into the Cretaceous .have been found on every continent . During about 210 million years of evolutionary history , they adapted to a wide range of habitats , including fresh water , terrestrial , and even coastal marine environments . Their life history is well understood , with fossils known from thestage ,, and maturity . Mostwere, although some were almost fully terrestrial , returning to the water only to breed . Thesewere some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land . Althoughare considered amphibians , many had characteristics , such as scales , claws , and armourlike bony plates , that distinguish them from modern amphibians . have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles . They were described at various times as,, and, although these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped inwere spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae .means " cut vertebrae " , as eachis divided into several parts .Experts disagree over whetherwere ancestral to modern amphibians  , or whether the whole group died out without leaving any descendants . Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of, another group of earlycalled, or even as descendants of both groups  . Recent studies place a family ofcalled theas the closest relatives of modern amphibians .in teeth , skulls , and hearing structures link the two groups .Manyare much larger than living amphibians , and superficially resemble. Others are smaller and resemble. Most have broad , flat heads that are either blunt  or elongated  . The skulls are rounded or triangular in shape when viewed from above , and are usually covered in pits and ridges . The rugged surfaces of bones may have supported blood vessels , which could transfer carbon dioxide to the bones to neutralize acidic build up in the blood  . Manyalso have canallike grooves in their skulls called sensory. The, which usually run around the nostrils and eye, are part of a lateral line system used to detectin water . Asanimals , mosthave small limbs with four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot . have larger , thicker limbs , and some even have claws . One unusual terrestrial,, has relatively long limbs for its body , and probably lived as an active runner able to chase prey . of most of the bones ofare also seen in other early, aside from a few bones in the skull , such as,, and, that have developed in sometaxa . Mosthavehorns in the backs of their skulls , rounded projections of bone separated from the rest of the skull bycalled ; in some, such as, they are pointed and very prominent . Among the most distinguishing features ofare the , two large holes in the back of the palate . Another pair of holes ,, are present in front of these, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth .often have teeth on their, as well as in their jaws . Some of these teeth are so large , they are referred to as. In some, such as,in the lower jawthe palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull .Very little is known of the soft tissue of. A block of sandstone , described in 2007 from the EarlyFormation of Pennsylvania , included impressions of the bodies of three. These impressions show , when alive , they had smooth skin , robust limbs withfeet , and a ridge of skin on their. to smallhave also been found inandrocks . The, called, are usually found in strata deposited around freshwater environments , suggesting the animals had some ties to the water .Unlike modern amphibians , manyare covered in small , closely packed scales . Theof mostare covered in rows of large ventral plates . During early stages of development , they first have only small , rounded scales .show , as the animals grew , the scales on theof their bodies developed into large , wide ventral plates . The plates overlap each other in a way that allows a wide range of flexibility . Later , such asand, have no evidence of scales . They may have lost scales to make movement easier under water or to allow , the absorption of oxygen through the skin .Several groups ofhave large bony plates on their backs . One,, has armourlike plating that covers both its back and underside . The also has extensive plating on its back . Most members of the familyalso have armor , although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates . Other, such as, have been found with small , disclike bonythat were in life probably embedded in the skin . All of thesewere adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle . Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of. Themay have provided stability for the spine , as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments .such asandthat may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine . are also seen in, but unlike,,, and, these animals are thought to have been fully aquatic .may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor , as bothandhave been considered close relatives of the group . ' vertebrae are divided into several segments . In living, the main body of theis a single piece of bone called the, but in, this region was divided into aand. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in:andvertebrae . Invertebrae , theare large and wedgeshaped , and theare relatively small blocks that fit between them . Both elements support a spinelike neural arch , and welldevelopedprojections calledstrengthen the connections between vertebrae . The strong backbone and strong limbs of many allowed them to be partially , and in some cases fully , terrestrial . Invertebrae , thehave been lost entirely , with theenlarged as the main body of the vertebrae . This weaker type of backbone indicates the spent more time in water . was named by GermanKarl Alfred vonin his second edition ofder, published in 1888 .remains were known since the early part of the 19th century , however . The earliest describedwas, named by Georg Friedrichin 1828 .namedfrom a single tooth , and considered it a reptile .means " breast tooth lizard " after the like shape of the tip of the tooth .The naming of these first specimens was disputed , however . Leopoldnamed the animalin 1837 . In 1841 , EnglishRichard Owen referred to the genus asto describe its highly folded orteeth . Owen thought the name" ought not to be retained , because it recallsthe idea of the mammalian genus, or else aform of the tooth ... and because the second element of the word ,, indicates a false affinity , the remains belonging , not to the, but to theorder of. " Owen recognized the animal was not a "" reptile , yet he also referred'sto the genus . Although the two genera both have similarly sized conical teeth ,was later found to be a crocodilelike reptile . Additional material , including skulls , firmly placedas an amphibian .also named in 1828 , basing it on partial, or back portion of the skull . In 1833 , he described a complete skull of S.that had the same teeth as his, making it the first known complete skull of a. Becausewas named first , it has precedence over the other names as a seniorsynonym .is still used as the name of an unrelated . and other similar animals were referred to as, named likefor teeth that were highly folded in cross section . Owen 's " " was later found at Guy 's, England by paleontologist William Buckland . Other specimens were found in the red sandstone of Warwickshire . As more fossils were uncovered in England , Owen depicted theseas the " highest " form ofand compared them to, which he considered the highest form of reptiles . He also noted the largeof the were younger than more advanced reptiles in theand, which are Latein age . Owen used these fossils to counter the notion that reptiles evolved from aprogression from early amphibians  .In addition to, some of the earliest named genera includedandin 1842 ,in 1848 ,in 1849 ,andin 1853 ,in 1858 , andin 1859 .is now placed as an earlyoutside, andis now considered areptile .Later in the 19th century ,were classified as various members of, a name coined by American paleontologist EdwardCope in 1868 . Cope placedin the class, the name then used for.means " roofheaded " in Greek , a reference to the wide , flat heads ofand other early. During this time ,consideredto be amphibians because they possessed three main features : gill arches in juvenile skeletons , indicating they were amphibious for at least the first part of their lives ; ribs that do not connect at the underside of the rib cage ; and deep pits in the skull that were interpreted as space forglands .Severalofwere recognized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Animals now regarded aswere primarily, but some were classified in the.were smallbodied and had simple conical teeth , whilewere larger and had complex , foldedand enamel in their teeth .included only a few forms , such asfrom Europe andfrom North America , that had poorly developed bones , external gills , and no ribs . Some skeletons ofwere later found with long ribs , prompting itsto . Soft tissue , such as scales and external gills , were found in many wellpreservedfossils from Germany . In the early 20th century ,would be recognized asforms oflacking many of the typical features that define the group , and is no longer recognized as a distinct group .Other animals that would later be classified aswere placed in a group called, characterized by platelike skull bones , small limbs , fishlike scales , andarches . Unlike, they did not have parietal, small holes in their skulls behind their eye.,,andwere placed in this group and were considered to be the most primitive members of. Theirvertebrae ,, and lack of  were features that were also shared with fishes . Thus , they were considered a link between early fishes and more advanced forms such as.Another group calledwas named by Cope in 1868 . Cope classifiedas aof, placing many small , amphibianlike animals within it . Among them were, once placed in.was later placed as awith other, but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians .By the end of the 19th century , most of what are today regarded aswere placed in the suborder. American paleontologist Case called it or " true" . The namesandwere usedto refer to the order in which it belonged . Theand, both of which contain, were distinct from. Withinwere the groups,, and. Members of, such asand, hadvertebrae with enlargedthat displaced the., such as,, and, had lost their, and themade up the entire body of the vertebrae .hadandthat were of equal size .are now identified asdistantly related to.In 1888 , vondividedamong three taxa :,, and. He placedin, a group which he characterized as having simple , shaped .included forms with thedivided intoand. All members ofhad composed only of the. Cope objected to von's classification , considering the vertebrae ofandindistinguishable because each had a simpleshape . He continued to useand to distinguish animals based on the absence or presence of . became a commonly used name at the turn of the century .included bothandin the group . Cope 'sandfell out of use . In 1919 , British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae .forms in thegraded intoforms in the, and finally intoin the. More importantly , Watson began using the termto refer to these groups . The namewas rarely used in the decades that followed . Swedish paleontologist removedfrom the group , narrowing its scope toand. His classification ofwas based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae .American paleontologist Alfredbrought the nameback into use in the later 20th century .used the namein a strict sense  to refer toand, excluding.agreed with this classification , but used the nameto avoid confusion within its wider sense  . Unlike modernclassification , however ,included the primitivein the group . first appeared in the Earlyaround 330 million years ago  . During the,included basal mediumsized forms such asor largeforms such as. Other , more derived, such as the, were smaller and more terrestrial . They resembled, and some taxa , such as the genus, even retained external gills like the modernday. During the latestand Earlyaround 300, several groups , such as theandevolved strong , robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted to life on land while others such as the, developed into largepredators . The, a group of small aquatic, evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the Late.During the Late, increasingand theof reptiles contributed into a decline in terrestrial, butand fully aquaticcontinued to, including the largeof Eastern Europe . Other, such as, developed longand a close similarity to, although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group . Theseincluded the largest known amphibian , the 9mlongof Brazil .Ascontinued toandin the Late , a major group calledbecame more dependent on life in the water . The vertebrae became weak , the limbs small , and the skull large and flat , with the eyes facing upwards . During theperiod , these animals dominated the freshwater ecosystems , evolving in a range of both small and large forms . During the Early one group of successful long fish , the, even adapted to a life in the sea , the only known amphibians to do so with the exception of the modern crabeating frog . Another group , the, includedand largesized animals 23 to 4 m  in length , with large and flat skulls that could be over a meter long in the largest forms such as. These animals spent most or all their lives in water as aquatic predators , catching their prey by a sudden opening of the upper jaw and sucking in fish or other small animals .In thestage of the Late ,were joined by the superficially very similar.are distinguished fromby the positioning of their eyenear the front of their skulls . Another group of, the, had wide heads with external gills , and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers . By this time ,had become a common and widespread component ofecosystems . Some, such asand, even inhabited Antarctica , which was covered in temperate forests at the time .were often the dominantanimals in their environments . Largeofwith hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern United States . They have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments . Recent studies show these densewere instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas . These environments seem to have had little diversity , as they were inhabited almost exclusively by.The Jurassic extinction event around 1996led to the extinction of most . Thesurvived , as well as a fewand. While the latter two groups soon became extinct ,persisted and grew to large sizes during the Jurassic . Among, theflourished in China and thebecame common in. The most recent knownwas the giant , known from the Early Cretaceous of Australia . It survived in rift valleys that were too cold in the winter forthat normally would have competed with them .was one of the largest of the, with an estimated weight of 500 kg  .Originally ,were classified according to the structure of their vertebrae . Early forms , with complex vertebrae consisting of a number of separate elements , were placed in the suborder, and largeaquatic forms with simpler vertebrae were placed in the suborder. With the recent growth of, this classification is no longer viable . The basiccondition is found in many primitive, and is not unique to one group of. Moreover , the distinction betweenandvertebrae is not entirely clear . Somehave,, andvertebrae at different points in the samecolumn . Other taxa have intermediate morphologies that do not fit into any category .is no longer recognized as a group , butis still considered valid . Below is a simplified taxonomy ofshowing currently recognized groups :Class OrderFamilyFamily Family Family Family Family FamilyFamily Family FamilyFamily Family FamilyFamilyFamily Family Family FamilyFamily Family Family In one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses of the group , recognized five characteristics that madea clade : a bone at the back of the skull , the, is connected to another bone on the underside of the skull , the; large openings called are present between the; the is connected to theand projects upward ; the, a bone in the pectoral, is thin ; and part of thecalled the to the neural arch . Additional features were given by Godfrey et al .  , including the contact between theandat the back of the skull , small projections  on the ribs , and a pelvicwith each side having a singleblade . These shared characteristics are called. are placed as basalin phylogenetic analyses , with their exact positioning varying between studies . Depending on the classification of modern amphibians , they are either included in the crown groupor the stem of. Crowngroupare descendants of the most recent common ancestor of all livingand stemare forms that are outside the crown group . Modern amphibians have recently been suggested as descendants of, which would place them within crown. Below is a cladogram fromet al .  placingwithin crown:Other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants ofand placein a more basal position within the stem of. Below is a cladogram fromand placingoutside crown:Most phylogenetic analyses ofinterrelationships focus on individual families . One of the first broadscale studies ofphylogeny was conducted by paleontologist Andrewin 1990 . A 2007 study made a "" of allfamilies , combining the familylevel trees of previous studies . The following cladogram is modified fromet al .  :1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 The most basal group ofis the superfamily.have several primitive orfeatures , including a single and a bone called thethat is absent in other.include the Lategenusand the family.has also been included in, and is the oldest knownfamily . is the oldest species , having been present over 330 million years ago during thestage of the Early. Recent analyses placeoutsidein a more derived position . Other primitiveincludeand.and, both described in 2005 from, are also primitive yet come from the Late. They are almost 40 million years younger than other basal, implying a long ghost lineage of species that are not yet known in the fossil record .In 2000 , paleontologists Adamand Anne Warren produced a revised phylogeny of more derived, naming several new clades . Two major clades wereand.includes thethat were once calledand includes two subfamilies , theand the.include small , mostly terrestrialthat may be the ancestors of modern amphibians .include largerlike. The second major clade ,, includes most , as well as somegroups . Withinare the superfamilyand the most derived, the. and Warren also named, a clade of small aquaticfrom the,, and. They placedwithin, but more recent studies disagree on their position . For example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than, while a 2008 study keeps them as basal.Within,and Warren erected two major clades :and.include large likewith flat heads and eyes near the back of the skull .include a diversity of, including large marine, aquatic,that survived into the Cretaceous , andwith eyes near the front of their heads . In 2000 , paleontologists and Andrewnamed a third major clade of, the. This group included more primitivethat could not be placed in eitheror, and included groups like,, and. Whileandare still widely used ,is not often supported as a true clade in recent analyses .andare now grouped with, butare still considered to be a primitive family of.A new phylogeny ofwas offered by paleontologist in 2013 . It supported many of the clades that were found byand Warren , but it did not find support for their division of derivedintoand.were found to be more closely related tothan to, which were grouped with. The clade includingandwas named. In addition ,named the clade containing allexcept and reinstated the namefor the clade containing allexceptand. Below is the cladogram from's analysis :Modern amphibians  are classified in.appear to have arisen in the. Molecular clock estimates place the firstin the Late, but the first member of is estimated to have appeared in the Middleusing the same technique . Using fossil evidence , there are three main theories for the origin of modern amphibians .One is that they evolved from . Another is that they evolved from, most likely the. A third hypothesis is thatdescended fromand frogs andevolved from.Recently , the theory thatwere the ancestors of allhas gained wide support . The skull morphology of some smallhas been compared to those of modern frogs and, but the presence of,teeth in small ,or immaturehas been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of theorigin of.inand many ,teeth havetips and bases . During the development of most, teeth begin toat their tips .normally proceeds downward to the base of the tooth , butfrom the tip stops abruptly inteeth .resumes at the base , leaving an area in the center of the tooth. This pattern is seen in living amphibians and fossils .Thefamilyis thought to be most closely related to. In 2008 , ancalled was named from Texas and was nicknamed the "" for its froglike head and like body . It was thought to be the most closely relatedtoand was placed as the sister taxon of the group in a phylogenetic analysis . Another species ofcalled is now thought to be even more closely related to. Unlike,was known since 1969 , and the presence ofteeth in its jaws has led some paleontologists to conclude soon after its naming that it was a relative of modern amphibians . It was first described as a "" , and the specific namemeans " connecting " in reference to its inferred transitional position betweenand. The structure of its, a disklike membrane that functions like an ear drum , is similar to that of frogs and has also been used as evidence for a close relationship . Other features including the shape of the palate and the back of the skull , the short ribs , and the smooth skull surface also point to it being a closer relative ofthan is. Below is a cladogram modified fromand showing the relationships of,, and:Although the earliestwere primarily, they had the ability to feed on land . Later ,and, some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed on land . Somebecame better adapted toward life in water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms . The first primarily aquaticwerein the.andbecame independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding .Most aquatichave flattened heads . When feeding , they probably opened their mouths by lifting their skulls instead of lowering their lower jaws . The jaw mechanics of the is well known , and is one of the most highly adapted .is thought to have lifted its skull to around 50 ° above horizontal through theof thejoint between the of the skull and the of the neck . As the skull is raised , thebone pushes forward and causes the lower jaw tooutward . Otherprobably also lifted their skulls , but they are not as well adapted for such movement .Watson was the first to suggest skull lifting as a means of feeding in. He envisioned that, a much largerthan, was able to make the same movement .also supported the idea in 1959 , suggesting thatalso fed in this way . At the time it was thought that theselifted their heads with strong jaw muscles , but it is now thought that they used larger muscles in the neck that were attached to the large pectoral., a close relative of, also has askeleton that muscles may have attached to .has very small teeth and a large area for muscle attachment behind the skull , suggesting that it couldfeed by rapidly opening its mouth .Unlike , terrestrialhave skulls that are adapted for biting landliving prey . Thebetween the bones of the skull in the are able to withstand a high degree of compression .forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey . Earlier aquaticandancestors differ fromlikein that their skulls were also built to withstand tension . This tension would have been experienced duringfeeding underwater .likewere among the firstthat were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting . , like all amphibians , reproduced in aquatic environments . Mostprobably reproduced through external fertilization . Like most living frogs , femalewould have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm tothem . Several fossils were described from the Earlyof Texas in 1998 that may be egg masses of . They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs . The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probablymembranes and like areas surrounding them that are most likelycoatings . They are attached to plant fossils , suggesting that theselaid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs . Themembranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians , not fish  , but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs . The eggs are thought to be frombecause they are likely to be close relatives of modern amphibians , and probably had similar reproductive strategies . They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found .One, the , may haveyoung in an area between the gills called the . Small bones belonging to youngerindividuals have been found in these pouches . The living Darwin 's Frog is also a mouthand would be the closest moderntoif it cared for its young in this way . An alternative possibility is thatwas, eating its young like many amphibians do today . If this was the case , the bones of these smaller individuals were originally located in the throat and were pushed into the as the animal.Body impressions of Early from Pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrialmated on land like some modern amphibians . They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water . The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that thewere gregarious . The head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display . Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern.While most types ofare distinguished on the basis of features in mature specimens , several are known from juvenile andspecimens .is seen in,, and, with aquatic larvae developing into adults capable of living on land . Several types ofdo not fully, but retain features of juveniles such as gills and small body size in what is known as.and the were alsobecause they retained gills , but they are only known from adult specimens . larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of aapparatus , a series of bones that gills would attach to in life . However , some fully maturealso possessbones but did not have external gills . A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults . Major body changes occur in, including theand strengthening of skull bones , theofbones , and an increase in body size . likeare known from both large adult specimens and small larvae , showing an extreme change in body shape . In these species , the shape and proportions of skull bones change in the early stages of development . The ornamentation on the surface of the skull roof also develops at this time . Small , regularly spaced pits are the first to form , followed by larger ridges . As development continues , the external gills disappear . Small teeth that once covered the palate are lost . Theskeleton does not develop at the same rate as the skull , with ossification  happening more slowly .and limb bones are poorly developed , ribs and fingers are absent in the early stages , and theandare entirely absent through most of development . Once maturity is reached , most bones have fully formed and growth rate slows . The bones of somelikeshow growth marks , possibly an indication that growth rate varied with the change in seasons .oflikeandshow that individuals grew larger past maturity . The oldest individuals usually have moreon their skulls with deeper.One group of, the, is also known fromspecimens .likeandare represented by many fossils preserving skin and external gills . An entire growth series is exhibited in the wide range of sizes among specimens , but the lack ofadapted adult forms suggests that thesewere. Unlike other, theirskeletons developed quickly but were still partlywhen fully mature . Adults likely had an aquatic lifestyle similar to juveniles . Recently , large specimens of were described with adaptations toward a terrestrial lifestyle , indicating that not allwere.While mostare aquatic in early stages of life , mostappear to have been terrestrial in their juvenile stage . Like other , adultwere adapted to alifestyle . Their bones are not highly developed for movement on land . The cross thickness of limb bones in adultshows that they could not withstand the stress of terrestrial.individuals have bones that are thick enough to withstand this stress , and could probably move about on land . To maintain a terrestrial lifestyle , a's limb bones would have towith positive, meaning that they would grow at a greater rate than the rest of the body . This is not the case in, meaning that as their bodies grew larger they became less adapted toward a terrestrial lifestyle . and other earlyhave rounded in the back of the skull that project into the cheek region . In life , thenotch would have been covered by a membrane called the, which is seen as a disklike area in living frogs . Theis involved in hearing , and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced. It was traditionally thought that thedeveloped very early inevolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of. Thus ,possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles . and all other livinghave a rodlike bone called thethat aids in hearing by transferringfrom the ear drum — or — to the inner ear .also have a, which projects into thecavity . Thelikely evolved from theof lobe fishes . The positioning of theand the shape of theregion suggests that theofand frogs are, but theof these amphibians are no longer consideredwith the hearing systems of reptiles , birds , and mammals . Therefore , ear structures inwere not ancestral to those of all other.The ability of theandto effectively transmitis calledmatching . Earlylikehave thickwith poormatching , so it is now thought that they were not used for hearing . Instead , these thickmay have functioned to support the tissue that covers thenotch . Earlylikecould not hear airborne sound but would have been able to detect vibration in the ground . Laterlikehadregions adapted to hearing .has a structure in the inner ear called the , which is also seen in frogs and is associated with hearing . Itsis also a betterof sound . The hearing system ofand relatedwas able to detect airborne sound and may have been ancestral to that of living amphibians .de Bayeux  was a medieval Englishand archdeacon in the Diocese of York . A relative of, the Archbishop of York ,probably owed his ecclesiastical positions to this relative . After's death ,was opposed to one of the candidates for the archbishopric , William, and worked to secure's deposition and replacement by Henry. After's death in,tried to prevent the return of, but these attempts were unsuccessful . Whendied suddenly in 1154 ,was accused of murdering the newly returned archbishop . Although he was never convicted of the murder in either a secular or an ecclesiastical court , he was stripped of his clerical status and became abefore. He died after, perhaps even after 1194 . was first mentioned in the historical record between 1121 and 1128 when he appears in a charter , which although likely a forgery , probably contains an authentic witness list . This document lists him as "archdeacon " , which means that he probably held theof Richmond . He was the nephew of, who was Archbishop of York fromto 1140 .he owed his position as archdeacon to his uncle and was probably appointed at a young age . A charter of's , dating to around 1138 , namesexplicitly as's nephew . was opposed to the election of Williamas Archbishop of York and supported William 's rival and successor Henry. Although he remained a supporter ofafter, he did oppose'sinAbbey , wherehad deposed one abbot and appointed another . In,deposed's choice as abbot ofand appointed another abbot . Originally ,had supported Elias,'s choice for abbot , but then changed his stance and helped with the deposition .After's death in,was opposed to William 's return as archbishop , but was unsuccessful in his attempts to prevent William 's. William died a week after his return to York , however , and, along with Robert of, the Dean of York , secured the quick election of the new archbishop , Roger deL. was accused of murdering William , specifically by poisoning him through the communion. A fellow,, who had been aof the deceased archbishop , brought murder charges against.obtained a hearing on the charges at a royal council presided over by King Stephen of England atin 1154 , but Stephen 's subsequent death prevented a resolution .attempted to have the trial switched to an ecclesiastical court and was supported in his efforts by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury . A trial was finally held inand'sdid not produce any witnesses , butwas unable to prove his innocence , prompting the transfer of the case to a papal court . No record of any judgment exists , butapparently appeared before two, Adrian IV and Alexander III . A further appeal to the papal court was referred to papal judgesdelegate between 1175 and 1180 .The case attracted commentary by two contemporary writers . John of Salisbury , who was a secretary for Theobald , added information aboutin a letter to Alexander III on unrelated business . In the section of the letter , John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about, he had failed to secure other clergy willing tothat he was innocent . Another contemporary , Gilbert Foliot , who was Bishop of Hereford , wrote to the pope to remind him that although'shad offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal , this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal . was no longer archdeacon by, as his successor is attested by that point ., however , continued to call himself " archdeacon " even though he held land as a secular lord , including lands in Lacy and. He also acted as a steward for Hugh de.was still alive in, as he was a witness to a document at York then , and may have been alive as late as 1194 , when Hughwas responsible for the farm of's lands , as the record of that transaction in theroll is unclear ifwas alive at that time or dead . had two sons , William de Bayeux andde.was a benefactor to a number of monasteries , including Drax Priory ,Priory andPriory . He also gave land to a hospital in York and to the Templars and Hospitallers . The Dvorak technique  is a widely used system to estimate tropical cyclone intensity  based solely on visible and infrared satellite images . Within the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The primary patterns used are curved band pattern  , shear pattern  , central dense pattern  , central cold cover  pattern , banding eye pattern  , and eye pattern  .Both the central denseand embedded eye pattern use the size of the. Thepatternstart at, equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity  . The shape of the central denseis also considered . The eye pattern utilizes theof the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Once a pattern is identified , the storm features  are further analyzed to arrive at a particular Tnumber . Thepattern indicates little development is occurring , despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature .Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors , including the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis andBranch  , the/ Analysis Branch  , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Meteorology andCommand in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .The initial development of this technique occurred in 1969 by Vernon Dvorak , using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest Pacific ocean . The system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model . As the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s , measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone 's lowpressure area . Use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes , using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself .on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s . The central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification , as the original estimates were 510 hPa  too low in the Atlantic and up to 20 hPa  too high in the northwest Pacific . This led to the development of a separate windpressure relationship for the northwest Pacific , devised by Atkinson and Holliday in 1975 , then modified in 1977 .As human analysts using the technique lead tobiases , efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs , which have been aided by higherresolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers . Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns canover time , automated techniques use a sixhour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates . Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998 , which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes  . It still required a manual center placement , keeping somewithin the process . By 2004 , an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and todetermine the tropical cyclone 's center . A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of theand cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique .In a developing cyclone , the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features , and as they strengthen , they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner . The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if the storm has weakened , maintained its intensity , or strengthened . Various central cloud and banding features are compared withthat show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity . If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity  . In each case a " Tnumber "  and a Current value are assigned to the storm . These measurements range between 1  and 8  . The Tnumber andvalue are the same except for weakening storms , in which case theis higher . For weakening systems , theis held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12 hours , though research from the National Hurricane Center indicates that six hours is more reasonable . The table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given Tnumber . The amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per 24 ‑ hour period is limited to 25 Tnumbers per day .Within the Dvorak satellite strength estimate for tropical cyclones , there are several visual patterns that a cyclone may take on which define the upper and lower bounds on its intensity . The primary patterns used are curved band pattern  , shear pattern  , central dense pattern  , banding eye pattern  , eye pattern  , and central cold cover  pattern . Both the central denseand embedded eye pattern utilize the size of the. Thepatternstart at, equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity  ) . The shape of the central denseis also considered . The farther the center isinto the, the stronger it is deemed . Tropical cyclones with maximum sustained winds between 65 miles per hour  and 100 miles per hour  can have their center ofobscured by cloudiness within visible and infrared satellite imagery , which makes diagnosis of their intensity a challenge .Thepattern , with its large and quickly developing mass of thickclouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame , indicates little development . When it develops , rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shieldthe circulation center . While it resembles apattern , it is rarely seen .The eye pattern utilizes theof the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within theusing rapid scansatellite imagery , whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every halfhour .Once a pattern is identified , the storm features  are further analyzed to arrive at a particular Tnumber .Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors . These include the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis andBranch  , the NationalandAdministration 'sAnalysis Branch  , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Pacific Meteorology andCenter in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii .The National Hurricane Center will often quote Dvorak Tnumbers in their tropical cyclone products . The following example is from discussion number 3 of Tropical Depression 24  of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season : INA / 35....THE12 THE .... THE30.Note that in this case the Dvorak Tnumber  was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the NHC decided to set the system 's intensity .The Cooperative Institute for MeteorologicalStudies  at the University of Wisconsin – Madison has developed theDvorak . This is a modified version of the Dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather thanhuman interpretation to arrive at anumber . This is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms . The China Meteorological Agency  is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future . The Indian Meteorological Department  prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum . The Japan Meteorological Agency  uses the infrared version of Dvorak over the visible imagery version . Hong Kong Observatory and JMA continue to utilize Dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall . Various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for 6 – 12 hours , though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious .Citizen science site Cyclone Center uses a modified version of the Dvorak technique topost1970 tropical weather .of Selected Tropical Storms and Associated TNumberThe most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available .estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within 5 miles per hour  of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time , though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropicalstorm force  ) and weakor typhoonforce  ) is the least certain . Its overall precision has not always been true , asin the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 miles per hour  . The method is internally consistent in that itrapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity . Some tropical cyclonesin strength more than the 25 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule , which can work to the technique 's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s . Systems with small eyes near the limb , or edge , of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique , which can be resolved through use of polarorbiting satellite imagery . Subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using Dvorak , which led to the development of thetechnique in 1975 .undergoing extratropical transition , losing their thunderstorm activity , see theirunderestimated using the Dvorak technique . This led to the development of the Miller andextratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances . New York State Route was a state highway in central New York in the United States . It served as a connector between NY 31 , its parent route , in the Cayuga County village ofand NY 5 in the Onondaga County town of Elbridge . NYwas assigned c . 1933 , replacing New York State Route 293 , a route assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The NYdesignation was removed in 1980 and replaced by County Route in Cayuga County and CR 99 in Onondaga County .NYbegan at an intersection with its parent route , NY 31 , in the Cayuga County village of. The highway went eastward , intersecting with NY 34 less than 01 miles  later . Much ofwas, with the highway passing residential homes and businesses as it progressed eastward through the village . The highway intersected with CRbefore leavingand entering the town of Brutus as Brutus Road .In Brutus , NYcontinued to the east through the rural town , intersecting CRand passing theRural Cemetery before turning to the southeast . After a short distance , the highway went through an isolated area of homes , where it intersected with CR 14 and CR. NYcontinued on , intersecting several local highways before crossing into Onondaga County and terminating at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Elbridge .What became NYwas originally designated as NY 293 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 293 was renumbered to NYc . 1933 , allowing the NY 293 designation to be transferred to another highway in Orange County . NYremained unchanged until January 2 , 1980 , when the NYdesignation was removed . and maintenance of NY's former routing was gradually transferred to the counties it went through , namely Cayuga and Onondaga . The first section to be transferred was the portion within Onondaga County , which was given to the county on April 1 , 1980 , and designated as CR 99 . The Cayuga County section of former NYwas transferred to the county one year later on April 1 , 1981 , and designated as CRfor the state route that preceded it . Benjamin Paul " Ben " Amos  is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Bolton Wanderers . Born in Macclesfield , Cheshire , Amos began his career with Crewe Alexandra 's youth academy , but joined Manchester United at the age of 11 . He has spent time on loan at Peterborough United , Molde , and Oldham Athletic . Additionally , Amos is an England youth international , having represented his country at every level from Under16 to Under21 .Amos was born in Macclesfield , Cheshire and was a member of the Crewe Alexandra academy until he was released at the age of 10 . While at Crewe , he also played for another local team ,United , as a centre midfielder . One year later , Amos was playing for his local team against the team at the top of the table , and they needed to win the match to win the league . Amos ' team 's goalkeeper was injured during the game , and as the tallest on the team , Amos was put in goal ; however , he had also been the team 's regular penalty taker all season , so when they were awarded a penalty , he went all the way up the pitch to take the kick . He scored , and his team went on to win the game 3 – 2 , together with the league title . After the game , his parents told him that a Manchester United scout had been watching him and that he had been invited for trials . Amos joined Manchester United at the age of 11 .In his first season at Manchester United , Amos became a regular starter for the club 's Under13 team , playing in 19 out of 27 matches in the 2001 – 02 season . Amos was named as an unused substitute for the Under18 side for the first time on 8 January 2005 , for a league game against Manchester City . His first appearance for the Under came exactly nine months later , on 8 October 2005 , coming on as a substitute for Danny Rose after starting goalkeeper RonRobertwas sent off in a 2 – 0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers . He was regularly named as an unused substitute during the 2005 – 06 season – including for two reserve team matches – but became a frequent starter for the Under in 2006 – 07 after signing a trainee contract in July 2006 . However , he missed the final of the 2006 – 07 FA Youth Cup with ashoulder .He retained his place in the Under18 team for 2007 – 08 , in addition to making his debut for the reserve team againstAthletic on 7 November 2007 , and during the season he impressed enough to be selected to go on the firstteam 's 2008 summer tour of South Africa . Amos was named as a substitute for all three matches of the tour , but did not play .route back from South Africa , United stopped off in Nigeria to play against Portsmouth on 27 July 2008 , with Amos replacing after 76 minutes . He made his competitive firstteam debut on 23 September 2008 in a 3 – 1 win at home to Middlesbrough in the third round of the League Cup . On 14 December 2008 , Amos travelled to Japan with the Manchester United squad for the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup , having been called up as a late replacement for Ben Foster , who had suffered a hand injury while training .On 29 October 2009 , Amos signed for the Championship team Peterborough United on a month 's loan as cover for Peterborough 's suspended firstchoice goalkeeper Joe Lewis . He made his only appearance on 31 October in a 2 – 1 defeat against Barnsley . After returning to Manchester United , Amos was again sent out on loan in March 2010 , this time to Norwegian side Molde, where he remained on loan until 30 June 2010 .Following the departure of Ben Foster from Manchester United to Birmingham City , United manager Alex Ferguson declared that Amos would be Manchester United 's thirdchoice goalkeeper for the 2010 – 11 season behind Edwin van derand . He made his first appearance of the season on 26 October 2010 , starting in goal for United 's 3 – 2 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers in the fourth round of the League Cup .In United 's final Champions League group match on 7 December 2010 , Amos was picked to start against Valencia at Old Trafford . Pabloscored Valencia 's only goal past him after 32 minutes of the match – the first goal United had conceded in the Champions League that season – as the two sides played out a 1 – 1 draw .With the signing of Danish goalkeeper Anders, Manchester United allowed Amos to join Oldham Athletic on loan for the remainder of the season on 7 January 2011 , although he would continue to train with Manchester United once a week . He made his debut againstTown the next day and kept a clean sheet . However , three days later , he conceded all six goals in a 6 – 0 defeat at home to Southampton ; he allowed Adam's 20yard shot underneath his body for the second goal , and he was rounded by Leefor the sixth .On 15 March 2011 ,was ruled out for five weeks following a knee injury , so Amos was recalled from Oldham to cover for Edwin van derand .Amos made his first start of the 2011 – 12 season in a third round League Cup tie atRoad against Leeds United . He kept a clean sheet as United cruised through to the next round winning 3 – 0 . He played again in the following round away at Aldershot Town , a game which United also won 3 – 0 and advanced to the quarter finals . He was in goal again for United 's League Cup game in a defeat against Championship club Crystal Palace on 30 November . It also seemed that he had moved above last season 's second choice in the pecking order , but was now third choice behind Andersand David de. He made his first Premier League start in a 2 – 0 home win against Stoke City on 31 January 2012 , keeping a clean sheet on his debut .On 30 May 2012 , Amos signed a threeyear contract extension with Manchester United , which will keep him at the club until at least 2015 .On 31 July 2012 , Amos joined Championship team Hull City on a seasonlong loan from Manchester United . Before the loan deal was completed , he had joined Hull on their preseason training camp in Portugal . He made his debut on 11 August 2012 in 7 – 6 penalty shootout victory over Rotherham United in the first round of the 2012 – 13 Football League Cup . However , after 19 appearances , including two in the League Cup , Amos returned to Manchester United on 3 January 2013 .On 15 November 2013 , Amos joined League One team Carlisle United on a monthlong loan from Manchester United .On 30 January 2015 he joined Championship club Bolton Wanderers on a month 's loan to provide competition for Andy Lonergan after was ruled out with an ankle injury picked up in training . On 21 February 2015 he made his Bolton debut as a substitute for the injured Lonergan as Wanderers lost 4 – 1 to Nottingham Forest at the City Ground . He played nine Championship games for Bolton before his loan expired on 4 April .Ben Amos returned to Manchester United after his loan spell at Bolton Wanderers , but on 10 June 2015 , it was announced on Manchester United website that Ben Amos has been released from the club along with four other players .On 1 July 2015 , Amos returned to Bolton Wanderers following his release from Manchester United , signing a fouryear contract with the club .Amos is an England youth international , having played for his country at the Under16 , Under17 , Under18 , Under19 , Under20 and Under21 levels . He was called up to the Under21 squad in 2011 for their friendly match against Iceland , but he was an unused substitute .As of 1 December 2015Manchester UnitedFIFA Club World Cup  : 2008Amos attendedHigh School , where he earned 11 GCSEs at grade C or above . Clayton Edward is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball  .

After a growthand further development of his pitches , he established himself as an elite high school prospect in 2006 when he posted a 13 – 0 record with an earned run average  of 077 , and recorded 139 strikeouts in 64 innings pitched . In a playoff game against Northwest High School of Justin , Texas ,pitched an allstrikeout perfect game . He struck out all 15 batters he faced in the game , which was shortened because of the mercy rule . He also pitched for USA Baseball 's Junior National Team in the Pan Am Championship .was selected by USA Today as " High School Baseball Player of the Year " , and was also theNational Player of the Year for baseball .Entering the 2006 Major League Baseball  draft ,was considered the top highschool pitcher available . The Los Angeles Dodgers selectedwith the seventh overall pick in the draft . He had committed to Texas A & M University , but turned down the scholarship offer to sign with the Dodgers , with a bonus estimated at $ 23 million . The bonus was the largest to any Dodgers draft pick at the time , and was eventually topped by Zach Lee in the 2010 draft . began his career with the Gulf Coast League  Dodgers . He pitched in 37 innings in which he struck out 54 batters  , while compiling a record of 2 – 0 with a 195 ERA . He featured a fastball that topped out at 96 miles per hour  and he was rated as the top prospect in the, and the Dodgers ' second best prospect by Baseball America behind third baseman Andy. was promoted to the Great Lakesin 2007 , where he recorded a record of 7 – 5 with a 277 ERA . He was selected to play on the East Team in the Midwest League AllStar Game and on the USA team in the AllStarGame . On August 6 , he was promoted to the DoubleA Jacksonville Suns in the Southern League , where he produced a 1 – 2 record and 365 ERA in five starts and was selected as the top prospect in the Dodgers organization heading into the 2008 season .During spring training in a game against the Boston Red Sox ,gained much attention for throwing a curveball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey but at the end looped into the strike zone and struck him out looking .was 0 – 3 and had a 228 ERA with 47 strikeouts through⁄ 3 innings pitched in his first stint of the year with the Suns . He was then called up to the majors on May 28 , 2008 , but optioned back to Jacksonville on July 2 . pitched 18 innings during his second trip to Jacksonville  , winning two games . During this stretch , he allowed only two runs earned runs , lowering his ERA to 191 . He was recalled on July 22 .On May 24 , 2008 , the Dodgers bought's minorleague contract , and he was added to the active roster .Tony Jackson called's debut the most anticipated start by a Dodgers pitcher since 's major league debut during the 1995 season . He made his debut on May 25 , starting against the St. Louis Cardinals . He struck out the first batter he faced , , the first of seven strikeouts in the game , in which he pitched six innings and allowed two runs . When he debuted ,was the youngest player in MLB , a title he held for one full year . won his first major league game against the Washingtonon July 27 , 2008 . He pitched sixplus shutout innings , allowing four hits , a walk , and he struck out five .finished his rookie season 5 – 5 , with a 426 ERA in 22 games  . He also pitched two innings out of the bullpen for the Dodgers in the 2008 National League Championship Series  against the Philadelphia Phillies .On April 15 , 2009 ,pitched seven innings , striking out 13 batters while allowing only one hit  against the rival San Francisco Giants . He was the youngestto ever strikeout 13 or more batters in a game since Sandydid it in the 1955 season . On May 17 , 2009 ,did not allow a hit against the Florida Marlins through 7 innings , then gave up a leadoff double to Florida 'sRoss . In 2009 , despite an 8 – 8 record , he led the major leagues in opposing batting average  , opposingpercentage  , and hits per nine innings  . He also posted an ERA of 279 and 185 strikeouts .also walked 91 batters , which was second most in the National League  . made his playoff starting debut against the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2009 National League Division Series  . He went 62 ⁄ 3 innings , striking out 4 , walking 1 , and ended up getting a nodecision  . At 21 years old , he started the opener of the 2009 NLCS against the Philadelphia Phillies and was the third youngest pitcher to ever start a playoff series opener , behind only Fernandoin the 1981 NLDS and Rickin the 2000 NLDS . started the 2010 season by posting a 307 ERA in April , but did so by walking 22 batters in 29 innings . On May 4 , he had his worst start of his career against the Milwaukee Brewers atStadium , throwing just 57 pitches in 11 ⁄ 3 innings , while retiring only four of the 13 batters he faced — including the pitcher . He wasloudly upon being pulled from the game .said after the game , " I didn 't give our team any kind of chance . It 's just not a good feeling to let your teammates down , let everybody down . It stings , it. I 've got to figure things out . " rebounded his next start by pitching an 8 inning twohitter and out the then undefeated . He credited his control of the slider being the major turning point for him . Later in the season , he was suspended for five games after hitting Aaronof the Giants with a pitch in a game on July 20 . The incident occurred after both teams were given a warning following Giants ace Timhitting Mattearlier in the game . He threw his first career complete game shutout on September 14 , 2010 also against San Francisco and finished the season with a record of 13 – 10 and a 291 ERA in 32 starts , pitching⁄ 3 innings and recording 212 strikeouts .After finishing the 2010 season strong , the Dodgers namedas the Opening Dayfor the 2011 season .

He produced his third career shutout on June 20 , a twohit , 11strikeout effort against the Detroit Tigers .became the first Dodgers starter to strike out the side in the 9th inning since Sandy's perfect game . In his next start , on June 26 ,pitched another complete game  . He became the firststarter to have backtoback complete game victories since Jeff Weaver in the 2005 season and the firstto have doubledigit strikeouts in consecutive starts since ChanHo Park in the 2000 season .

By the 1980s and ' 90s , such work was being exhibited internationally . The first artists , including all of the founders of the artists ' company , were men , and there was resistance among themen of central Australia to women also painting .

Head VI is an oiloncanvas painting by the Irishborn Englishartist Francis, the last of six panels making up his " 1949 Head " series . It shows a bust view of a single figure , modeled on Diego's Portrait of Innocent X.applies forceful , expressive brush, and places the figure within a glass cage structure , behind curtainlike. This gives the effect of a man trapped andby his surroundings , screaming into anvoid .Head VI was the first of's paintings to reference, whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of " screaming" , a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works . Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in's work . The hanging object , which may be a light switch or curtain, can be found even in his late paintings . Thecage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985 – 86 masterpiece , Study for a SelfPortrait —.Head VI was first exhibited in November 1949 at the Hanover Gallery in London , in a showing organised by one of the artist 's early champions , Erica. At the time ,was a highly controversial but respected artist , best known for his 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a, which made him theterrible of British art . Head VI drew a mixed reaction from art critics ; John Russell , later's biographer , at the time dismissed it as a cross between " an of its jaws and aninwho has come to a bad end " . In 1989 Lawrencewrote that the " shock of the picture , when it was seen with a whole series of heads ... was indescribable . It was everything. The paradoxical appearance at once of pastiche andwas indeed one of's most original. " Art critic and curator David Sylvester described it as a seminal piece from's unusually productive 1949 – 50 period , and one of's finest. 's output is characterised by sequences of images . He told Sylvester that his imagination was stimulated by sequences and that " images breed other images in me " . His series were not always planned or painted in sequence ; sometimes paintings are grouped for convenience but vary in execution and tone . The idea for the head series came after he returned, late in 1948 , from a stay in. In the previous three years he had been unable to find a voice ; the last surviving canvas from this period is his Painting  . Although he continued to paint , he was a ruthless self critic , given to with, and no works survive from between 1947 and the winter of 1948 .Ericaofferedthe opportunity of a solo show for the opening of her new Hanover Gallery . He agreed , but had nothing in reserve to hang . In following years ,became perhaps the most important of's early champions ; she arranged this showing — his debut solo exhibition — publicised him widely and organisedfor international.Already 40 years old ,viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination . Because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years , he had little choice but to present new works . He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show , but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year , and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition , completing the series barely in time for the opening .The paintings depict isolated figures enclosed in spaces that are, overwhelmingly,and eerie . Coming early in's career , they are uneven in quality , but show a clear progression especially in how theyand present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with . Head I  and Head II showpieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads ; they have halfopen eyes and a, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human . Heads III , IV and V show fully formedrecognisable as men , and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere . These two broad ideasin Head VI , which is astortured as the first two paintings , and as spectral as the middle three . In Head VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments , the first indication in's work of the influence of, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream . said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge . This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas " in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendousand drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . " He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often wouldmidway through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that " perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit. " This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a ratherstudy of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking ofmasterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to for the subsequent 20 years .The series marks's first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms . For him , the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated ,, and had abandoned the need to present an outward face . He believed that under these circumstances allfalls away , and the social being becomes the sum of its, whichattempted to convey by reducing the subject to its barebones features : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw . According to Russell , " the view out front ceases to be the only one , and our person is suddenly, fragmented , and subject to strange. " Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting , the figures are always posed , and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed . Thisis abandoned in's series .Head I , completed late in 1948 , is considered more successful than Head II . Although it is wellregarded critically , Head II is seen as something of a creative desac , while Heads III , IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards Head VI . It is exceptional in'sthat works of their relative poor quality survive ; he wasselfcritical and oftenor abandonedbefore they were completed . When pressed again byin 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had beenfor a year , he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on , including several other. commissioned another showing to be held in 1950 , for whichpainted three largemodelled on's portrait . The gallery advertised the show as " Francis: Three Studies from the Painting of Innocent X by" , but in the endwas dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened .The figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing . It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract threedimensional glass cage . This framing device , described by Sylvester as a " spaceframe " , was to feature heavily throughout the artist 's career . Ahangs from the upper edge of the glass case , falling just in front of the pope 's face and partially covering his eyes . It is toodrawn to identify with certainty , but given the presence of similar objects in's later works , may be either the end of a hanging light switch or theof a curtain ; the hangingwas to become a signature for the artist . Apart from its symbolic meaning , it has afunction , framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines . Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973, May – June 1973 , where it is clearly a dangling light bulb . For, these elements were intended to make the figurein and out of sight for the viewer , alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off ,open or closed .The figure 's mouth is opened wide as if screaming , an expressiontook from a still he kept of the nurse screaming in 's Odessa Steps massacre sequence in his 1925 silent film Battleship. In 1984 , the broadcasterBragg askedabout the still , and observed that in his earlier career the artist seemed preoccupied with theof the human mouth .replied , " I had always thought that I would be able to make the mouth with all the beauty of alandscape though I never succeeded in doing so . " When Bragg asked why he thought he had failed ,said , " It should be all much more colour , should have got more of the interior of the mouth , with all the colours of the interior of the mouth , but I didn 't happen to get it . " His interest in the mouth was further stimulated by a medical textbook oforal cavities bought in a secondhand, kept in his studio and to which he often referred to .The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure 's voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in silence .later in life ,said that he had " wanted to paint the scream more than the horror . I think , if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful " . The work evokes memories of the Second World War . The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen asphotographs of Adolf1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a similar cage .strongly resisted literal comparisons though , and stated that he used the device so he could frame and " really see the image – for no other reason . I know it 's been interpreted as being many other things . " Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radioof late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending. Denis Farr notes thatwas sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to" shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey [ ing ] the harsh atmosphere of an. "The socalled " space frame " had already been used by Albertoin the 1930s , and the two artists became friends in the 1960s . Howeverhad by 1949 used it only incontexts before's, and in turn influenced his use in " The Cage " of 1950 . A similar two dimensional construct is found in Henry Moore 's works , notably his "for King and Queen " , constructed three years after's Head . It is difficult tohow these artists influenced and informed each other . What is notable is thatcontinued to use the motif , with intervals until the end of his life . Sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 Three Studies of the Male Back .The fulllength golden curtainlike folds painted in heavy brushare in part influenced bybut also similar to's 1558 Portrait of Cardinal Filippo. the Old Master 's device to isolate and distance the sitter from the viewer ; the black groundpaint is visible through the folds , making the separation all the more affecting .had already used similar forms in his Chicago panel , and they were to become a feature of his most acclaimed 1950s works , especially in his " screaming" . He became fascinated with the veil or curtain as a motif in painting , and collected many reproductions of works byandin which it is employed . He had begun his career as an interiorand designer of furniture andin the mid1930s , and later said that he liked " rooms hung all round with justhung in even folds " .orappear in's earliest works , notably the 1949 Study from the Human Body , always in portraits and always in front of , rather than behind , the figure .Head VI is closely modelled on's c . 1650 Portrait of Innocent X , today in the Gallery , Rome .cautiously avoided seeing the original , even when he spent three months in Rome in 1954 . Critics speculate he was afraid of being disappointed , or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination . Yet his fascination was allconsuming and he reproduced variants of itfor almost two decades ; an examination and homage described as " without parallel in the history of art " .'s approach differs to's in a number of ways : both artists were expressive , yet's broad brush and freedom with paint contrast with's tight and controlled treatment . He 's positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer 's point of view , elevating andhim . This was already a common technique in commercial , promotional photography but in's hands ,argues , the angle places the pope on a kind of stage for the viewer toobserve .Althoughrevered's portrait , he did not try and reproduce the earlier painting . In interviews , he said that he saw flaws in's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as , according to art historian , " obsolete and decayed " .'s approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again , thereby making acomment on the treatment of royalty in both old master and contemporary painting . Yet's influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting . The sitter 's pose closely echoes the original , as does the violet and white colouring of his cope , which is built up through broad , thick , brush . The influence can be further seen in the goldcoloured ornaments on the back of the seat that extend on both sides of the figure . Art historian describes the work as a mixture ofand subversion that pays tribute to, while at the same timehis painting .Sylvesterthe influence of late works byin other aspects , especially in the deep and rich colouring ,'s portrayals of Philip IV , and agrees with identification ofof Edgaras a source . He believesborrowed fromthe use of parallel heavy folds to create the illusion of whatdescribed as "" , as seen in the earlier artist 's After the Bath , Woman drying herself . Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in's Portrait of Cardinal Filippo. He believes the folds serve to " push the viewer back " , creating a distance from the subject , an effect he sees as similar to the separation between and orchestra and setting ; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison . Sylvester describes them as anof backgroundinto stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter . In his "with Francis" series of books , he askedwhy he found the effect so poignant . The artist replied , " Well , it means that the sensation doesn 't come straight out at you butslowly and gently through the gaps . "When asked why he was compelled to revisit theso often ,replied that he had nothing againstper, but merely sought " an excuse to use these colours , and you can 't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting into a sort of falsemanner .

" Sylvester notes thatwas impressed by Picasso 'sand handling of paint , especially in Picasso 's 1930s works ; and suggests that the whitearound the pope 'smay be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a in an.Whenundertook the series late in 1948 he was something of a twohit wonder . He had success in 1944 with Three Studies for Figures at the Base of aand to a lesser extent with Painting  , both of which were highly regarded but viewed as. The exhibition was a success , and marked his critical breakthrough . Until then , he had been highly regarded but capable of only occasional. The full show established him in the minds of critics as , according to Michael, " more of a force to bewith in the contemporary scene " . While some found his imagesand, they wrote about him all the same , sealing his reputation as theterrible of postwar British art . The critic for The Observer wrote , " The recent paintings ...as they are , cannot be ignored . Technically they are superb , and the masterly handling of large areas ofgrey , flushed with a sudden pink or green , only makes me regret the more that the artist 's gift should have been brought to subjects so esoteric " .Most critics focused on Heads I and VI , remarking favourably on the progression between the two . While some found the inherent violence of the paintings,was a skilled publicist and turned the bad press into notoriety , and brought's work to national attention .notes that the exhibition showedno longer neededmaterial to make an impact , and was now capable of creating an intense emotional response through more subtle means , and had found a way of presenting the human condition in the way he had sought , by presenting his sitter " in asetting , a cage or [ behind ] a parted... the rest , the most essential , lay in the manipulation of the infinitelymedium of oil paint " . After the showinggradually became " less thewith an occasional image of and more a force to bewith on the contemporary scene " . His reputation and the value of his panels rose dramatically , and after the showing he was sought after by European , American and African collectors and galleries , commanding prices as high as  400 for single works , unusual for a contemporary British artist of the time .Head VI was first exhibited at the Hanover Gallery , London , in 1949 . It was acquired by the Arts Council 'sGallery in 1952 . Thehas loaned it out a number of times since , including for majorat the Grand, Paris in 1971 , and the Hugh Lane Gallery , Dublin , in 2000 .In May 1996 , the National Gallery took on loan's Innocent X portrait and hung it alongside fourpaintings ; Head VI , Pope I  , Pope 1961 and Pope 1965 .believes thatwould have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted , but writes that two , including Head VI , " stood up to it , and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power " .was a movement in early 20thcentury AngloAmerican poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear , sharp language . has been described as the most influential movement in English poetry since the activity of the Pre . As a poetic style it gaveits start in the early 20th century , and is considered to be the first organizedliterary movement in the English language .is sometimes viewed as ' a succession of creative moments ' rather than any continuous or sustained period of development . Renéremarked that ' It is more accurate to considernot as a doctrine , nor even as a poetic school , but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles ' .Therejected the sentiment andtypical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry , in contrast to their contemporaries , the Georgian poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition . In contrast ,called for a return to what were seen as more Classical values , such asof presentation and economy of language , as well as a willingness to experiment with nontraditional verse forms .use free verse . publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures , both in poetry and in other fields . Thegroup was centered in London , with members from Great Britain , Ireland and the United States .unusually for the time , a number of women writers were majorfigures .A characteristic feature ofis its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence . This feature mirrors contemporary developments in avantgarde art , especially. Although objects through the use of what Ezra Pound called " luminous details " , Pound 'sMethod of juxtaposing concrete instances to express anis similar to's manner ofmultiple perspectives into a single image .Wellknown poets of theera of the 1890s , such as Alfred Austin , Stephen Phillips , and William Watson , had been working very much in the shadow of Tennyson , producing weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era . They continued to work in this vein into the early years of the 20th century . As the new century opened , Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate , a post which he held up to 1913 . In the century 's first decade , poetry still had a large audience ; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy 's The, Christina's posthumousWorks , Ernest's Poems , George Meredith 's Last Poems , Robert Service 'sof aand John'sand Poems . Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats wasmuch of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage , producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period . In 1907 , the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded toKipling .The origins ofare to be found in two poems , Autumn and A City Sunset by T. E.. These were published in January 1909 by the Poets ' Club in London in a booklet called For Christmas.was a student of mathematics and philosophy ; he had been involved in the setting up of the club in 1908 and was its first secretary . Around the end of 1908 , he presented his paper Aon Modern Poetry at one of the club 's meetings . Writing in A. R.'s magazine The New Age , the poet and critic F. S. Flint  was highly critical of the club and its publications . From the ensuing debate ,and Flint became close friends . In 1909 ,left the Poets ' Club and started meeting with Flint and other poets in a new group whichreferred to as the "Club " ; they met at theTower restaurant in London 'sto discuss plans to reform contemporary poetry through free verse and theandand the removal of all unnecessaryfrom poems . The interest in Japanese verse forms can be placed in a context of the late Victorian andrevival of interest inandas witnessed in the 1890s vogue for William Anderson 's Japanese prints donated to the British Museum , performances ofplays in London , and the success of Gilbert and Sullivan 'sThe . Direct literary models were available from a number of sources , including F. V.'s 1866 is, or ,by a Century of Poets , Being JapaneseOdes , the first Englishlanguage version of the , a 13thcentury anthology of 100, the early 20thcentury critical writings and poems ofHartmann , and contemporary Frenchlanguage translations .The American poet Ezra Pound was introduced to the group in April 1909 and found that their ideas were close to his own . In particular , Pound 's studies of Romantic literature had led him to an admiration of the, direct expression that he detected in the writings ofDaniel , Dante , and , amongst others . For example , in his 1911 – 12 series of essays I gather the limbs of Osiris , Pound writes of Daniel 's line "dem "   : " You cannot get statement simpler than that , or clearer , or less" . These criteria of, clarity and lack of rhetoric were to be amongst the defining qualities ofpoetry . Through his friendship with Laurence, Pound had already developed an interest in Japanese art by examining e prints at the British Museum , and he quickly became absorbed in the study of related Japanese verse forms .In an article in La France , 1915 , the French critic ,dedescribed theas descendants of the Frenchand in a 1928 letter to the French critic and translator René, Pound was keen to emphasise another ancestry for, pointing out thatwas indebted to atradition , linking back via William Butler Yeats , Arthur Symons and the' Club generation of British poets toand thesource was amplified further in's study published in 1929 , in which he concluded however great the divergence of technique and language ' between the image of theand the ' symbol ' of thethere is a difference only of precision ' . In 1915 , Pound edited the poetry of another 1890s poet , Lionel Johnson for the publisherMathews . In his introduction , he wroteIn 1911 , Pound introduced two other poets to theTower group : his former fiancée Hilda and her future husband Richard. These two were interested in exploring Greek poetic models , especially, an interest that Pound shared . The compression of expression that they achieved by following the Greek example complemented the proto interest in Japanese poetry , and , in 1912 , during a meeting with them in the British Museum tea room , Pound toldandthat they wereand eventhe signature to some poems they were discussing .When Harriet Monroe started her Poetry magazine in 1911 , she had asked Pound to act as foreign editor . In October 1912 , he submittedthree poems each byandunder the ,  with a note which describedas ' one of the '' . This note , along with thenote  in Pound 's book  entitledare considered to be first appearances of the word in print . 's poems ,, To a Greek, and, were in the November issue of Poetry , and' s , Hermes of the Ways ,, and, appeared in the January 1913 issue ;as a movement was launched . Poetry 's April issue published what came to be seen as "'s enabling text " , the like poem of Ezra Pound entitled " In a Station of the Metro " :Theof these faces in the crowd ; on a wet , black.The March 1913 issue of Poetry contained A Few Donby anand the essay entitledboth written by Pound , with the latter being attributed to Flint . The latter contained thisstatement of the group 's position :Direct treatment of the " thing " , whetheror objective .To use absolutely no word that does not contribute to the presentation .As regarding rhythm : to compose in sequence of the musical phrase , not in sequence of the.Pound 's note opened with a definition of an image as " that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time " . Pound goes on to state , " It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produceworks " . His list of " don" reinforced his three statements in "" , while warning that they should not be considered asbut as the " result of long contemplation " . Taken together , these two texts comprised theprogramme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past .Flint commented " we have never claimed to have invented the moon . We do not pretend that our ideas are original . "The 1916 preface to SomePoets comments "does not merely mean the presentation of pictures .refers to the manner of presentation , not to the subject . " to promote the work of the, and particularly ofand, Pound decided to publish an anthology under the title Des. It was first published in Alfred's little magazine Theand was later published in 1914 by Alfred and Charlesin New York and by Haroldat the Poetryin London . It became one of the most important and influential Englishlanguage collections of modernist verse . Included in the thirtyseven poems were ten poems by, seven by, and six by Pound . The book also included work byFlint , , Amy Lowell , William Carlos Williams , James Joyce , FordFord , Allenand John was also another included in the important 1963 anthology by William Pratt ThePoem Modern Poetry in miniature .Pound 's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed withprecepts , rather than active participation in a group as such . Williams , who was based in the United States , had not participated in any of the discussions of theTower group . However , he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines . Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound , as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier , Preinfluenced style towards a harder , more modern way of writing . The inclusion of a poem by Joyce , I Hear an Army , which was sent to Pound byYeats , took on a wider importance in the history of literary, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication , at Pound 's behest , of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The. Joyce 's poem is not written in free verse , but in rhyming. However , it strongly reflects Pound 's interest in poems written to be sung to music , such as those by theand . The book met with little popular or critical success , at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do , and a number of copies were returned to the publisher .The following year , Pound and Flint fell out over their different interpretations of the history and goals of the group arising from an article on the history ofwritten by Flint and published in Thein May 1915 . Flint was at pains to emphasise the contribution of theTower poets , especially Edward. Pound , who believed that the " Hellenic hardness " that he saw as the distinguishing quality of the poems ofandwas likely to be diluted by the "" of, was to play no further direct role in the history of the. He went on to cofound thewith his friend , the painter and writerLewis .Around this time , the AmericanAmy Lowell moved to London , determined to promote her own work and that of the otherpoets . Lowell was a wealthyfrom Boston whose brother Abbott Lawrence Lowell was President of Harvard University from 19091933 . She loved Keats and cigars . She was also an enthusiastic champion of literary experiment who was willing to use her money to publish the group . Lowell was determined to change the method of selection from Pound 'seditorial attitude to a more democratic manner . This new editorial policy was stated in theto the first anthology to appear under her leadership : " In this new book we have followed a slightly different arrangement to that of our former Anthology . Instead of an arbitrary selection by an editor , each poet has been permitted to represent himself by the work he considers his best , the onlybeing that it should not yet have appeared in book form . " The outcome was a series ofanthologies under the title SomePoets . The first of these appeared in 1915 , planned and assembled mainly byand. Two further issues , both edited by Lowell , were published in 1916 and 1917 . These three volumes featured most of the original poets ,  , with the exception of Pound , who had tried to persuade her to drop thename from her publications and whodubbed this phase of" Amy . "Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes , making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an.Moore also became associated with the group during this period . However , with World War I as a backdrop , the times were not easy for avantgarde literary movements  , and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of theas a movement .In 1929 , Walter suggested thatshould produce a newanthology ., by now a successful novelist , took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford andThe result was theAnthology 1930 , edited byand including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell , who had died ,, who had disappeared , and Pound , who declined . The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of thein the history of 20thcentury poetry .Of the poets who were published in the variousanthologies , Joyce , Lawrence andare now primarily remembered and read as novelists .Moore , who was at most a fringe member of the group , carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained anconcern with compression of language . William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken " from the mouths of Polish mothers " . Both Pound andturned to writing long poems , but retained much of the hard edge to their language as anlegacy . Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of.Despite the movement 's short life ,would deeply influence the course of modernist poetry in English . Richard, in his 1941 memoir , writes : " I think the poems of Ezra Pound ,, Lawrence , and FordFord will continue to be read . And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the. "On the other hand , Wallace Stevens found shortcomings in theapproach : " Not all objects are equal . The vice ofwas that it did not recognize this . " With its demand for hardness , clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevantemotionshad later effects that arein T. S. Eliot 's '' and ' Morning at the Window ' and in D. H. Lawrence 's animal and flower pieces . The rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteentwenties owed much to the of the Georgian Poetry style .The influence ofcan be seen clearly in the work of thepoets , who came to prominence in the 1930s under the auspices of Pound and Williams . Theworked mainly in free verse .linking's principles with's , Louisinsisted , in his introduction to the 1931issue of Poetry , on writing " which is the detail , not, of seeing , of thinking with the things as they exist , and of directing them along a line of melody . "was a major influence on the Language poets , who carried thefocus on formal concerns to a high level of development . Basil, anotherpoet , was a key figure in the early development of the British Poetry Revival , a loose movement that also absorbed the influence of the San Francisco Renaissance poets . influenced a number of poetry circles andtheFree verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form . In the 1950s , especially , with the Beat generation , the Black Mountain poets , and others associated with the San Francisco Renaissance . In his seminal 1950 essayVerse , Charles, the theorist of the Black Mountain group , wrote " A " ; hisderived from and supplemented the.Among the Beats , Garyand Allen Ginsberg in particular were influenced by theemphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry . William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets , encouraging poets like Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg 's . Operation Eastern Exit was thegiven to the military evacuation of the United States embassy in Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia , in January 1991 . In late December 1990 , violence quickly enveloped the city as armed militants beganwith government soldiers . On 1 January 1991 , the US Ambassador to Somalia , JamesBishop , contacted the Department of State requesting an evacuation of the embassy , which was approved the following day . United States Central Command began planning andforces that evening . The initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the Mogadishu International Airport , but this was later abandoned . A helicopter evacuation via the USS Guam and USSwas the remaining option .On the morning of 5 January , a 60person Marine and Navysecurity detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH Superhelicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation . The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61. Throughout the day , foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy . Four waves of five CH46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January . Thewere transported to Muscat , Oman , where they disembarked on 11 January . In total , 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated , including 12 heads of missions  .In the late 1980s , there was increasing rebellion against the rule of Somali President Siad Barre , a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses . By 1990 , what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war , with several militias organized to overthrow the central government .In July 1989 , the embassy moved to a new , 80acre  compound , 6 miles  from the previous embassy and James K. Bishop was appointed as the United States ' ambassador to Somalia . Ambassador Bishop had significant experience in crisis management at US embassies . In 1967 , he was at the US Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon when the SixDay War erupted . About 3600 Americans were evacuated in 33 hours ; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city . As deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1981 – 87 , Bishop chaired several task forces forand gained experience in the State Department 's operations center aswere carried out during several coups d. During his previous assignment as Ambassador to , Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war inspread , when he left in March 1990 . Soon after returning to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia , he was appointed to ato deal with the crisis in, which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August .On 1 August , before leaving the US to take up his post in Mogadishu , Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command — the military command for the Middle East and northeast Africa — where he spent most of the day with its commander , Gen. Norman. Ambassador Bishop , aware of the ongoing, believed " the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances . " Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut andthe importance of being prepared to deal withand spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy 'sand plan until he was " satisfied ... that [ Central Command ] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that . " In its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit , the Center for Naval Analyses cited the Ambassador Bishop 's previous experience and " clear understanding of his role " in the operation as one of the reasons Operation Eastern Exit went so well . after Ambassador Bishop 's visit to Central Command , Iraq invaded Kuwait . In 1979 , the US negotiated access to an airport and port in both Mogadishu and; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area , maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait .An increasing level of criminal violence prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents  and nonessential staff in early December , although fighting between the government and the United Somali Congress  remained no less than about 100 miles  away . The voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation . By 19 December , the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 ; around the same time , fighting between the government and rebels came within about 40 miles  of Mogadishu .On 30 December , violence escalated " an order of magnitude " as militants entered Mogadishu , which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness . On 30 – 31 December , diplomats , including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city , were collected and housed in the embassy compound , except two volunteers who remained in the embassy 's K7 residential apartments located acrossRoad from the embassy . The volunteers in the K7 building would be needed as lookouts for the embassy compound 's main gate . On the morning of 31 December , the defensewas nearly killed when his vehicle waswith bullets and that evening , a soldier at a roadblock shot theof a vehicle carrying another defense official . Attempts by the US and other nations ' diplomats , in particular the Italian embassy , to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful .Road became a " shooting gallery , " preventing those in safe outside the embassy from reaching it . On New Year 's Day , the first American civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy .Ambassador Bishop requested an evacuation of the American community on 1 January , indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned Italian , French , or German evacuation efforts , but preferred an evacuation by the US military . The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and on that day , Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military , thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit . Ambassador Bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussingplans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts . Ultimately , ten heads of missions — eight ambassadors and twod— along with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated .Ambassador Bishop had visited Central Command in August 1990 , where he worked with military experts to update the embassy 's E & E plan . The first notice that an evacuation of the Mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of 1 January , when the top naval commander at Central Command sent a message to his naval operations staff : " Better havecrowd take a look at a of Mogadishu ! time / distance to get there from area . " Following the ambassador 's 2 January evacuation request , the commander of Central Command ordered Air Force aircraft to the region , the movement of amphibious ships to Mogadishu , and requested United States Special Operations Command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation .The initial plan was to evacuate via Mogadishu International Airport . Soon after the evacuation request , the United States Air Force deployed C130 transport planes and an AC130 , for gunfire support , to, Kenya , awaiting clearances to enter Somalia and the ability to safely transferfrom the embassy to the airport . However , the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances . It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective commandandcontrol structure , making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage . Likewise , government troops faced a commandandcontrol problem ; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines , in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with . Thus , it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible . Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu , but faced the same problems of landing and transit ofto the airport .On 4 January , several incidents , including a couple exchanges of gunfire , suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armeduntil the USS Guam and USSarrived with their helicopters and soldiers , at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January . The embassy had just six Marine guards , whose job was limited to protecting the. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived . The request was denied , but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning .USS Guam and USSbegan transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22 : 30  on 2 January . The commander ofGroup Two had initially proposed a sevenshipTask Group , composed of vessels anchored atIsland  and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation . However , intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf , thus the decision to send two of the closest ships . Although the two vessels were selected by midafternoon on 2 January , the transfer of some personnel from Dubai tocaused a delay of eight to ten hours . Guam andcarried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade , including a detachment of CH Superhelicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the US military — and two squadrons of CH46 Sea Knight helicopters .Planning began in earnest as the ships got underway , with a combined command center on Guam . On the morning of 3 January , the task force 's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force ; the request was denied . A warrant officer who had previously served as a Marine Security Guard at the Mogadishu embassy during the mid1980s was found . Despite Ambassador Bishop 's planning with Central Command , the task force was provided outdated information . The formertold planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior . In fact , the new embassy was located further inland and , after receiving updated information , task force commanders determined that a beach landing , requiring troops to fight their way across the city , was too risky . Initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at 01 : 00 on 7 January . However , in response to indications from Ambassador Bishop that conditions in Mogadishu were deteriorating , planners considered 1050nauticalmile  and , later , 890nauticalmile  flights with the CH while the ships were still located in the northern Arabian Sea . The situation in Mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until 5 January .On the evening of 4 January , the final execute order was issued for a 02 : 45 launch of two CH Superto arrive at the embassy at dawn . The 60 soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition . Two Marine Corps 130tankers were mobilized closer to the operation , from Bahrain to Oman , to refuel the helicopters en route to Mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred fromto Guam .Two CH Supercarrying a 60man security detail — 51 Marines and nine Navy— departed Guam at 02 : 47 ,nautical miles  from the embassy , and were expected to arrive at 06 : 20 . They performed two aerial. During the first, a pipe burst on one of the helicopters ,soldiers in fuel and nearly forcing a return to the Guam ; problems with the helicopters ' navigation system also complicated therendezvous . The helicopters arrived in Mogadishu at dawn , crossing the coast just south of the harbor at 25 – 50 feet  in altitude on a route that was planned to avoid areas of more intense violence reported in the northern parts of the city . On their arrival in Mogadishu , the crew of the helicopters were using an outdated 1969 map , which showed the embassy in an isolated area . Furthermore , they had been told the embassy could be discerned by its white stucco perimeter wall and golf course . The embassy was , in fact , surrounded by new development and the crew saw white stucco walls around many buildings in the city . The helicopters were flying too low to spot alight which was placed on the embassy 's water tower  and the golf course in the embassy compound had a black , oilcoated surface — not the familiar green grass that the helicopter crew wouldbreaking radio silence  to contact the embassy , they were able toit and land at 07 : 10 . As they arrived , a group of about 100 to 150were attempting to enter the embassy compound viaon the wall , but scattered as the helicopters arrived .The security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the Air Force 's AC130 arrived to provide overhead support . Ambassador Bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement : they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound 's walls with obvious hostile intent . He also identified three zones of defense , stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force :the entire embassy compoundthe Chancery , Joint Administrative Office  building , Marine House , and the helicopter landing zone theandbuildings Ambassador Bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail , which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu . He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the US was intervening in the conflict . To this effect , he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict . The Marines who had beenin fuel during thewere able to take a shower and wash their clothes .After an hour on the ground , the helicopters left with the first 61, including all American civilians and four heads of mission .were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm .with the only inflighton the return nearly prevented, which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue . At 9 : 40 , the helicopters arrived on Guam andthe.No threats came upon the embassy during the day , althoughof armedfrequently drove by the embassy alongRoad . Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy . A sniper and awere positioned on the embassy 's water tower  and came under fire ; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower .The Office of Military Cooperation , just one and a half blocks from the embassy , required evacuation . Despite its proximity to the embassy , an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest . A convoy of vehicles with several Marines andleft the embassy at 8 : 47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the . This was the onlyoutside the embassy by the security detail . Throughout the day , foreign diplomats contacted the embassyto be evacuated ; the US welcomed these requests , but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy .A Somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy , Major Siad , agreed to travel to rescue the Germandand British ambassador  . The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; Ambassador Bishop , a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart , agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy . Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January , they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer . At the request of Ambassador Bishop , Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets , but only if he was paid enough ; the US embassy paid Major Siad , who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff . The brother of President Barre , who was also a Major General and Chief of Police , showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador .The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center  , which was set up in the. A 44person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle thewas planned for insertion with the CH Superafter they had returned to the Guam . However , this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail . The deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail . Thewere grouped into 15person " sticks " to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece . Some attempted to bring more , resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation . Furthermore , manyhad pets they wanted to bring , which were not allowed . Most pets were killed by their owners ; some were given poison . Meanwhile , the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy 's, such as candy ,, and souvenirs  . They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy ; thefilled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship .As evening approached , work began to prepare thefor the main evacuation . The area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated . Some cars had to be broken into to be moved . Chemical lights were placed in thein a NATO " Y " pattern . The entire mission would be conducted with night vision, which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off .The main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of 6 January and consisted of four waves of five CH46 helicopters . The timing of this phase was determined by range of the CH46 Sea Knight , which lack aerialcapability ; the ships were about 350 – 380 nautical miles  away during this phase . An AC130 was sent from Saudi Arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two 1 Iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support , but were not deployed .The first wave departed Guam at 23 : 43 . As the second wave landed , Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by twoof soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other . His request to speak with the ambassador was granted . Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation . He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued . The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major , who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador 's armored car . Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major fromon the deal . The final wave departed the embassy at 1 : 49 and landed on Guam at 2 : 23 ; twenty minutes later , Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete .Armedwere observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed . The doors of the— the main building of the embassy — were reportedly blown open bywithin two hours of the embassy 's evacuation . Somali employees of the embassy — known as foreign service — could not be evacuated . Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employeesto safer parts of Somalia . Many of thehad sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal . Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the. The Ambassador left thewith keys to theand warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed .A total of 281were taken from the embassy , including 12 heads of missions  and 61 Americans  . The heads of mission were the ambassadors of the United States , Kenya , Nigeria , Soviet Union , Sudan , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , and United Kingdom and theof the embassies of Germany , Kuwait , Oman , and.Rather than disembark in nearby, as originally thought by the, the ships were ordered back to Oman — a fiveday journey . The sailors and marines made way for theto share living quarters . When theof Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for thewhile aboard the vessel , two hundred signed up within an hour , and some of the sailors even dressed up asto ease the ordeal for children . At the request of the ambassadors , a formal session with the ships ' senior officers was held to express their thanks . On 11 January , thewereat Muscat , Oman . That afternoon , the Americanwere flown to Frankfurt , Germany , from where they continued home . The 2010Shield was the 57thShield tournament , the premier baseball competition in Australia , and was held from 6 November 2009 to 7 February 2010 . It was hailed as the precursor to the new Australian Baseball League that will start in the place of theShield in late 2010 to early 2011 . The Victoriadefeated South Australia two games to nil in the championship series to win the tournament ; this was the 22nd time theShield had been awarded to a Victorian team . The competition was sponsored by's.At the conclusion of the regular season , the Victoriafinished in first place with a 17 – 7 record , earning homefield advantage for the threegame championship series . South Australia hosted the threegame semifinal series against the New South Wales. Both teams finished with a 14 – 10 record . The Perth Heat  and Queensland both failed to qualify for the finals .In June 2009 , it was announced that the rights to theShield had been sold to a new Australian Baseball League  , with ownership split between Major League Baseball 's 75 percent share and the 25 percent share owned by the Australian Baseball Federation . The 2010 tournament was considered preparation for the inauguralseason starting in 2010 – 11 . It varied from the 2009Shield by expanding the season to include ten rounds . Since an uneven number  teams were involved , four teams paired off for each round and played a threegame series , while the remaining team took a bye . During the season , each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team , one at home and one away . In total , the schedule allowed for 24 regularseason games per team before a postseason similar to the 2009 edition : the firstplace team directly qualified for the championship series and played against the winner of a playoff series between the second- and thirdplace teams .During the regular season , games were played on a Friday night and aon Saturday ; in eachone of the two games was shortened to seven innings . The exception to this was when Perth played their home games ; they played on a Thursday night instead of aon Saturday . Each postseason series was scheduled for a Friday , Saturday and Sunday .The 2010 series allowed each team to make use of a 19man active roster .were made in two cases that allowed teams ' activeto expand to 21 players , both times for the same reason . Two games during the season had to be postponed because of poor weather . Both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season ; makeup games were scheduled at the start of the return series between the teams , and this resulted in two fourgame series . In both cases , the teams had a 19man roster for the makeup game , and an expanded 21man roster for the originally scheduled series .The 2010Shield was contested between five teams from around Australia . In previous years , many of the teams had played their home games at multiple venues . This season each team held their home games at only one venue . There was one scheduled exception to this at the start of the season : the New South Wales' final home series against the Perth Heat was held at Gilchrist Oval , whereas all of their other home games were held atBaseball Stadium .As a result of poor attendance atBaseball Park , game one of the fifthround series between New South Wales and the Victoriawas moved to LaUniversity , Melbourne . Although thegames had attracted crowds of no more than 500 , the moved game had an attendance of 2200 . Though no further regular season games were moved , the finals series hosted by thewas held at LaUniversity as well .The venues are as follows :† — A game postponed from Round 7 , held in Round 8 , was played with Victoriaas the away team and Queenslandas the home team , despite being played atBaseball Park ,, Victoria . — A game postponed from Round 3 , held in Round 9 , was played with South Australia as the away team and Victoriaas the home team , despite being played at Norwood Oval , Adelaide , South Australia .The Queenslandwere the first team to be eliminated from contention for the finals , after being swept four games to nil by the Victoriain round 8 . The following round saw South Australia clinch a position in the finals , despite finishing the round in second position . It was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided : theclinched top spot by sweeping the Perth Heat , which combined with the New South Walessweep of theeliminated Perth from contention and secured the last finals spot for the.The 2010Shield made use of the same finals structure as had been used in the 2009 season . The top three teams at the conclusion of the ten rounds of regularseason games qualified . The second- and thirdplace teams faced in each other in a bestofthree series hosted by the secondplace team . The winner of that series then faced the firstplace team for a bestofthree series . South Australia hosted the New South Walesat Norwood Oval , Adelaide , while the Victoriahosted the championship series at LaUniversity , Melbourne . In the finals , the home team and away team alternated during each of the series . As a result , South Australia was officially the away team for game two of its series against New South Wales , as was Victoria in the championship series .After defeating thetwo games to one in the semifinal series , South Australia progressed to the championship series against the. There they were defeated two games to nil . After game two of the championship series , Victoria 's Matthewwas named bothShield Final Series MVP and Pitcher of the Year .At the conclusion of the finals series , the winner of two awards were announced . Matthewwon both the Pitcher of the Year award and the Finals Series MVP award . At the Baseball Australia Diamond Awards , held on 6 March at the Hotel Grand Chancellor , Adelaide , Waynewas announced as the 35th winner of the Helms Award ; theShield 's Most Valuable Player award .was the first pitcher to win since 1986 . Runnersup by two votes were Pauland Michael Collins .is the thirteenth Spanishlanguage studio album bysingersongwriter Ricardo, released on 23 September 2011 .

The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly below averageperiod of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development of 31 tropical depressions , of which 21 became named storms ; of those , 14 became. Though every month with the exception of February and March featured tropical activity , most storms developed from May through October . During the season , tropical cyclones affected the Philippines , Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , Indochina , and various islands in the western Pacific .The season ran yearround , with the first storm ,, developing west of the Marshall Islands on January 15 . In April , Typhoonbecame one of the longestlasting Pacificin history and attainedrecords for its unusually early impacts . Typhoon Imbudo in July caused several deaths and extensive damage across the Philippines and China . In September , Typhoonbecame one of the costliestin recorded history after striking South Korea ;was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season with a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar  . In late November , Typhoondevastated areas of Yap State in theStates of. The season closed with theof a tropical depression east of the Philippines on December 27 .The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2003 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Tokyo Typhoon Center . Tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center  have the " W "added to their number . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine,and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names .On March 5 , 2003 ,from the University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk issued an extended range forecast for the typhoon season , noting the likelihood of near average tropical cyclone activity as a result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures . The forecast indicated the potential for 262 tropical storms , compared to the 10 – and 30year average of 278 and 263 storms , respectively . The following month , the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 267 , indicating a slightly above average season . Over next two months , however , fluctuations in sea surface temperatures , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast . A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise theirto indicate a nearaverage season in their final August forecast update , which predicted 27 tropical storms . The group was very accurate in their, with their April and Augustbeing the most accurate .Similarly ,working with the City University of Hong Kong issued a seasonal projection on April 24 , 2003 , indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16. As with the, the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the El NiñoSouthern. The City University of Hong Kong revised theiron June 24 , 2003 , indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to 30 . The group was also accurate in theirfor the entirety of the Northwest Pacific , though their specializedfor the South China Sea were substantially off .During the year , the Japan Meteorological Agency  issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula , and north of the equator ; this was due to the agency 's status as the official RegionalMeteorological Center , as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989 . The JMA issuedand analyses four times a day , beginning at 0000 UTC and continuing every six hours . The JMA issuedbased on atropical cyclone forecast model . The agency estimated 10 minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction . The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin , operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the interests of the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific.Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial Pacific were above normal , including those in the South China Sea . Areas of convection persisted yearround in the lower latitudes , particularly around the Philippines .divergence was also prevalent in the same regions , resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 – 2000 30year average . In 2003 , the JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity ; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the ratio between tropical storms andwas 66 % greater than normal . The Philippine,and Astronomical Services Administration  monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA .The season began with the formation of Tropical Stormon January 15 . After itsfive days later , no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months . This period of inactivity ended with the formation of Typhoonin midApril ;was one of the longest lived Pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with 1minute sustained winds of at least 240 km / h  in April since Typhoon Isa in 1997 . Tropical activity was enhanced from May to June , and during this period the JMA monitored four tropical storms , while the PAGASA monitored a fifth storm off the eastern Philippines . Three of the four tropical storms monitored by the JMA approached or hit Japan , including Typhoon, which brought heavy rainfall and wind across theIslands and the Korean Peninsula .Tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of June and first half of July . The second half of July , however , featured the development ofImbudo and, which both tracked westward across the Philippines before striking areas nearand other regions of southeastern China . Imbudo caused the deaths of 78 people and US $million in damage . August was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis , with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the JMA , JTWC , and PAGASA . This included and, which also struck southeastern China . Typhoonearlier in the month made landfall in Japan , resulting in 17 deaths . was somewhat below average in September , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall ,. However ,was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly US $ 48 billion in damage , mostly in South Korea . Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after August , with October featuring only three tropical storms . However , two ,and, reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land . November featured less storms but wasaverage , with twodeveloping . The second typhoon ,, devastated portions of Yap State , resulting in approximately $ 17 million in damage . In December , the JTWC and PAGASA monitored a sole tropical system east of the Philippines , though the JMA did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month .In storm information below , windspeed advisories differ from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center  to the JMA as the JTWC uses the United States criteria of 1minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds , while the JMA uses the 10minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds . This difference generally results in JTWC maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the JMA for the same cyclone .On January 11 , the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop intonear the International Date Line . As the system tracked westward , it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . On January 14 , surface observations indicated that the lowpressure area had developed a closed , lowlevel circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone , satellite imagery remained inconclusive . Nonetheless , the JMA classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Islands at 0600 UTC on January 15 . The JTWC would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 UTC later that day . At the time , the depression was tracking westnorthwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north . Over the next day the systemin convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remainedas the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical depression .Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would againin strength , resulting in a briefby the JTWC to tropical depression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in itsas a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name. At roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply northeastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated thatpeaked in strength late on January 18 with 1minute sustained winds of 60 km / h  , the JMA considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm .by the same nearby subtropical ridge ,would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . The JMA downgradedto tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its lowlevel circulation centerfrom the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear . At 0000 UTC , both the JTWC and JMA discontinued the monitoring of. developed from a broad area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April 9 well removed from any. Shortly after development ,quickly intensified in its early stages , and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis .slowed afterwards , though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April 14 .continued and late on April 15 ,reached its peak intensity with winds of 165 km / h  and a minimum barometric pressure of 930 mbar  . Following peak intensity ,would begin to track northwest andin strength ,an additional two times in intensity . On April 21 , the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to trackfor several days east of Taiwan . However , on April 24 ,would resume a northward track and begin to weaken , and on April 24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on. Following landfall ,transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on April 25 , which persisted until crossing the International Dateline towards the end of April 2003 .Shortly after developing ,caused two fatalities inin addition to minor agricultural and infrastructural damage ; similar effects were felt in Guam . Several days later , the typhoon prompted cyclone warnings and othermeasures in the Philippines afterindicated the potential for strong winds and rain . However , ultimately any effects in the archipelago associated withremained minimal . The typhoon also prompted warning products in Taiwan , making it the first April typhoon since 1978 to cause such a feat . Unlike in the Philippines , however ,would bring significant rainfall to Taiwan . Effects from the typhoon were most significant in Japan , particularly in theIslands . Strong winds , rain , and waves caused US $ 230000  in agricultural damage onIsland . One person was killed due to injuries resulting from the waves . In, heavy rainfall , peaking at 196 mm  inPrefecture , was reported . Overall , despite its distance away from land and weak intensity at the time of its sole landfall ,resulted in three fatalities . on May 18 , the JTWC began to monitor an area of persistent disturbed weather associated with a broad lowpressure area southwest of. Within highlyconditions , the disturbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC the following day . In its initial stages , the depression tracked slowly. However , atrough forced a weakness in a nearby ridge , allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined , northward path . At 1200 UTC on May 20 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chan . Following the system 's naming , Chan temporarily meandered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track . The next day , the storm began to develop an eye ; this was reflected with an upgrade by the JMA to typhoon status at 0600 UTC on May 23 .intensification followed , and at 1800 UTC that day Chan reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 155 km / h  and a minimum pressure of 940 mbar  .Following peak intensity , Chan began to intake dry air beginning on May 25 . At roughly the same time , the typhoon began to weaken and accelerate towards the northeast . Conditions continued toas the storm moved further north , and as the cyclone passed east of, it was downgraded to tropical storm classification . By this time , Chan had lost much of its convection due to wind shear . Early on May 27 , Chan had fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and these remnants continued to track towards the northeast . These extratropical remnants dissipated south of theIslands the following day . Early in the typhoon 's existence , Chan posed a potential threat to Guam , but remained well east of the island . However , after passing to the northeast , winds from the typhoon fanned volcanic ash from the recently volcano towards the island , promptingmeasures in Guam .were reported on the island , forcing the cancellation of several flights . As a tropical storm , Chan caused some damage to homes and crops on, mostly due to heavy rains brought forth by the storm . Offshore , a 1 ton fishing vessel , the , sank during the storm . The ship was valued at $ 16 million .Tropical Stormdeveloped as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May 25 . The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis . However , intensification leveled off asexecuted a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May 27 . Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened andbefore reforming in the Philippine Sea . Afterwardsbeganand reached its peak intensity on May 29 with maximum sustained winds of 100 km / h  and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar  . Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May 30 ; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea ofon June 4 .The erratic and slow movement ofoff the western Philippines was the catalyst for extreme rainfall and flooding , killing 41 persons in the archipelago . Precipitation peaked atmm  near. Risingresulted in the temporaryof government offices and numerous mudslides . In addition , strong winds caused widespread power outages . Overall damage fromin the Philippines amounted to1923 million  . The floods also displaced 8367 people in 1 families and destroyed 178 homes .and its extratropical remnants later brought torrential rainfall and widespread flooding to Japan , particularly in southwestern regions . Rainfall there peaked atmm  . Flood damage was worst inandPrefectures , where several buildings were destroyed by. Other locations in Japan experienced considerable agricultural damage as well as numerous landslides . Overall ,caused roughly $ 282 million in damage , much of which occurred in Japan , though the entirety of deaths associated with the cyclone took place in the Philippines .In late May , an area of disturbed weather began to persist in the South China Sea . The JTWC began to monitor the storm cluster on May 29 . The following day , the JMA reclassified the system as a tropical depression ; initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack of deep convection .moderate wind shear and dry air prevented the cyclone from strengthening significantly in the storm 's early stages . These conditionsas the depression tracked northeast , and at 0000 UTC on June 1 , the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm. Throughout the course of the day ,continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast , and peaked in strength with a barometric pressure of 985 mbar  and maximum sustained winds of 95 km / h  , making it a severe tropical storm .However , upon moving through theChannel , conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear , weakening the system and resulting in itsto tropical depression status by the JMA at 1200 UTC on June 3 .continued to become increasingly disorganized as it moved further north , and late that day , the depression transitioned to an extratropical cyclone . The resulting remnants continued to track well east of Japan before dissipating on June 7 . Due to its track away from, damage remained minimal ; however , aspassed to the south and east of Japan , the storm brought light rainfall to the country , peaking at 81 mm  in, Okinawa .A tropical disturbance persisted in the monsoon trough northwest ofon June 7 , and moved westward without development due to wind shear . On June 11 , the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize , and the next day the JMA classified it as a tropical depression northeast of. On June 13 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Stormto the east of the Philippines , and PAGASA gave it the local name "" .moved to the northwest and later to the north , parallel to the eastern Philippines , and on June 17 , the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status . The storm rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan as it developed a welldefined eye , and while doing so passed over the Japanese island ofat aroundUTC on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km / h  , while the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h  . Increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen on June 19 , and later that day the JMA declared the storm as extratropical near theIslands . The extratropical remnants ofcontinued to the northeast , crossing northern Japan on June 20 and dissipating on June 24 .While offshore the Philippines ,dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless . The storm caused131 million  in damage and 12 deaths . On the Japanese island of, where wind gusts reached 204 km / h  . It also affected Taiwan , where floods covered highways and caused mudslides . In Japan , the storm caused widespread power outages , although damage was minimal , and there were 21 injuries . In South Korea , there was $ 121 million in damage and two deaths .On July 15 , the JMA estimated that a tropical depression formed , and the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depressionaboutkm  east of Yap . A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the westnorthwest for much of its duration . With warm waters and favorable upperlevel conditions , the depression quickly organized , first to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July 17 , and to typhoon status two days later , when PAGASA begin issuing advisories on Typhoon. Around that time , Imbudo was rapidly intensifying , developing a welldefined eye . At 1200 UTC on July 20 , the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km / h  , and the same time , the JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 240 km / h  , making it a super typhoon . Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12 hours , before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle . At 0300 UTC on July 22 , Imbudo struck northern Luzon , with 1 minute winds estimated at 205 km / h  by the JTWC . It weakened over land , but reintensified in the South China Sea , striking southern China near Yangjiang , Guangdong on July 24 . Imbudo rapidly weakened , dissipating on July 25 .In the Philippines , officials evacuated over 14000 people . Imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike since Typhoonfive years prior , The typhoon left widespread areas flooded for several days . Damage was heaviest in the Cagayan Valley , where over 80000 people were displaced by the storm . In Isabela , high winds wrecked most of the banana crop and severely damaged other crops . Throughout the Philippines , Imbudo damaged or destroyed 62314 houses , causingbillion  in damage . There were 64 deaths in the country . In southern China in Yangjiang , more than 30000 people evacuated ahead of the storm , and more than half of the trees in the city fell due to strong winds . High winds killed a man in Hong Kong after knocking him off a platform . Throughout Guangdong , Imbudo destroyed 595000 houses and caused eight deaths . Heavy rains spread across southern China , peaking at 343 mm  atCounty in Guangxi province . There , 12 people died from the storm . Overall damage in China was about ¥ 445 billion  . originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines on July 15 . Tracking westward , intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17 . Upon moving into the South China Sea , conditions allowed for quicker strengthening , and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h  , making it a severe tropical storm . However , atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate asmade landfall onon July 21 , weakening the system . The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf ofprior to a final landfall near Hanoi , Vietnam the following day . Tracking inland , the combination of land interaction and wind shear causedto dissipate over Laos on July 23 .Shortly after development ,tracked through the Philippines , killing two people . After moving into the South China Sea , turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines . Three of the plane 's occupants received minor injuries . In,caused heavy rainfall , peaking at 189 mm  at a station onMountain . The rains resulted in the collapse of 1400 homes and an estimated¥ 14027 million  in direct economic losses . Effects were worst in Vietnam , where three people were killed . Widespread power outages occurred , and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage , particularly in Vietnam 's northern provinces . spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July 31 . Tracking northwest , favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on August 2 .reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km / h  and a minimum barometric pressure ofmbar  . This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system ; this was followed bymaking landfall on southern Taiwan on August 3 . Subsequently , the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near, China the next day . The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland , and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall .In Taiwan , wherefirst made landfall , heavy rainfall resulted in flooding . Commercial flights , schools , and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm . Precipitation there peaked at 653 mm  over a period of nearly two days inCounty .damage also resulted from the rainfall , and was estimated at over$ 70 million  . In China , record rainfall was reported . The worst impacted city was, where losses due toreached¥ 240 million  and one death was reported . Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China . Due todrought conditions , 703 cloudoperations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall ; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area . Overall ,caused roughly $ 31 million in damage and three deaths .A tropical depression developed on August 2 southeast of Guam , and gradually intensified while moving to the northwest , becoming a tropical storm on August 3 and a typhoon a day later .formed an eye and became a large storm by the time it approached Okinawa on August 7 . The typhoon attained peak winds of 155 km / h  before weakening slightly while turning to the northeast .made landfall on the Japanese island ofon August 8 , and later moved across portions ofand. After weakening to tropical storm status , the cyclone became extratropical on August 9 and dissipated three days later .While passing northeast of the Philippines , the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago . The eye crossed over Okinawa , whereleft 166800 people without power and caused 10 injuries . Near wherefirst struck Japan ,reported a peak wind gust of 166 km / h  , at the time the third strongest on record there . The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking atmm  . The combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides , particularly on. Nationwide ,killed 20 people , destroyed 708 houses , and caused ¥ 351 billion  in damage . originated from a tropical disturbance within the monsoon trough east ofState on August 13 . Despite rather favorable conditions , the initial tropical depression did not intensify significantly and degenerated into a remnant low on August 18 . However , these remnants were able to reorganize and the system was reclassified as a tropical cyclone a day later .was rather rapid upon the storm 's– the depression reached tropical storm status on August 20 and then typhoon intensity two days later . Shortly after ,made landfall on Luzon at peak intensity with winds of 120 km / h  . The typhoon emerged into the South China Sea as a much weaker tropical storm , though it was able toover warm waters . Once again at typhoon intensity ,before moving over thePeninsula on its way to a final landfall near , Vietnam on August 25 . Quick weakening due to land interaction occurred asmoved across northern Vietnam , where the storm met its demise the following day . first struck the Philippines , resulting in heavy rainfall andapproximately 1000 families . The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person .'s effects were much more severe in China . In Hong Kong , eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon 's outer rainbands . However , Guangdong Province ,Province , and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted . The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi . In those three regions combined , 13000 homes were estimated to have collapsed and a largeof farmland was damaged . Two people were killed in China and economic lossesto ¥ 21 billion  . Due to its positioning and track , of all areas in Vietnam only the country 's more northern regions were impacted by. Flash flooding occurred in earnest in those regions , and 1000 homes were flattened . One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam . Overall , the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons .The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of August , one of which became Tropical Depressionnear the Philippines . On August 18 , an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation , developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon . It moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening , such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction . On August 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Stormto the east of Taiwan . Later that day , the circulation passed just 55 km  north of, although the convection was exposed that time . On August 20 , the JMA assessedas dissipating in the Taiwan Strait , although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China .Rainfall in Taiwan reached 69 mm  in Ilan County . On the island , the storm left several hundred houses without power due to a lightning strike . On mainland China , rainfall peaked at 101 mm  in, Zhejiang , which were largely beneficial indrought conditions , while winds gusted to 100 km / h  . The storm damaged or destroyed 5880 houses and flooded 1 ha  offields , causing ¥ 386 million  in damage .On August 27 , a tropical depression developed about 520 km  northwest of Guam , which initially drifted to the southwest before turning to the northwest . On August 29 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm, and that day PAGASA began issuing advisories on Tropical Storm. The storm quickly intensified into a typhoon , after developing an eye in the center . On September 1 , the JMA estimatedattained peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h  , and the JTWC assessed peak 1 – minute winds of 230 km / h  . While near peak intensity , the center ofpassed about 45 km  south of the southern tip of Taiwan . The typhoon weakened steadily and was a severe tropical storm by the time it made landfall on September 2 just east of Hong Kong . The JTWC estimated landfall winds of 185 km / h  , making it the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979 .rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China , dissipating on September 3 over Guangxi .In the Philippines ,interacted with the monsoon to produce heavy rainfall , killing one person . While in the vicinity ,produced gusts of 100 km / h  on, a Japaneseof Okinawa . Heavy rainfall in Taiwan reached 628 mm  inCounty , and winds peaked at 176 km / h  on Orchid Island before thewas destroyed . The caused about$ 200  in crop damage , and killed three people . Damage was minor in Hong Kong , and four fishermen were missing and presumed drowned after their boat sank . On the Chinese mainland , strong winds left 90 % of the city ofwithout power , and killed 16 construction workers due to a halffinished building collapsing . Across Guangdong , the typhoon damaged crops and destroyed 54000 homes were destroyed . Overall damage in China was estimated at ¥ 23 billion  , and across Guangdong , the typhoon killed 40 people .Typhoonformed on September 4 from the monsoon trough in the western Pacific Ocean . It slowly intensified into a tropical storm while moving northwestward , andbecame a typhoon on September 8 . That day , it quickly intensified due to favorable conditions , developing a welldefined eye and reaching peak maximum sustained winds of 195 km / h  . While near peak intensity ,wasand began turning to the northnortheast . The eyewall soon after passed over the Japanese island ofon September 10 , producing the fourth lowest pressure on record in Japan after a pressure ofmbar  was recorded . With warm waters ,was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of, South Korea on September 12 . OnIsland ,produced a peak wind gust of 216 km / h  and a minimum pressure of 950 mbar  , both setting records for the country , and making it the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea since recordkeeping began in the country in 1904 . The typhoon became extratropical in the Sea of Japan the next day , although the remnants persisted for several more days , bringing strong winds to northern Japan .The typhoon first affected theIslands of Japan . On, strong winds damaged 104 buildings , and 95 % of residents lost power .dropped heavy rainfall there , including rates of 585 mm  in an hour , and 4025 mm  in 24 hours , the latter setting a record . One person died onafter being struck by flying glass . Elsewhere in Japan , the storm caused flights to be canceled , while rainfallinduced landslides blocked roads . There were two other deaths in Japan , and damage totaled ¥ 113 billion  . Damage was heaviest in South Korea , notably where it moved ashore . Winds innear the landfall location reached 154 km / h  , the secondhighest on record . There , the port sustained heavy damage , causing disruptions to exports in the months following the storm . Nationwide , the high winds destroyed about 5000 houses and damaged 13000 homes and businesses , leaving 25000 people homeless . About 147 million lost power , and widespread crop damage occurred , resulting in the worst rice crop in 23 years . Across South Korea ,killed 117 people , and overall damage totaled552 trillion won  .In the middle of September , the monsoon trough spawned a rapidly organizing disturbance eastnortheast of Luzon , with weak wind shear and favorable conditions . On September 16 , the JMA classified it as a tropical depression , and the JTWC initiated advisories the next day . The system moved to the northwest due to the subtropical ridge to the northeast and later to the north . On September 18 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm, the same day that PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm. An eastwardmoving trough turned the storm to the northeast , bringing the track over Okinawa and on September 19 .continued gradually intensifying , becoming a typhoon on September 20 to the southeast of Japan . That day , the JMA estimated peak winds of 130 km / h  , and the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 185 km / h  on September 21 , afterdeveloped a welldefined eye . The typhoon weakened due to increasing wind shear , deteriorating to severe tropical storm status on September 22 before JMA declared it extratropical on September 23 . The remnants ofcontinued to the northeast , exited the basin on September 24 , and eventually struck southern Alaska on September 25 .Wind gusts in Okinawa reached 115 km / h  , while on the volcanic island of, gusts reachedkm / h  . On the Japanese mainland , winds gusted to 126 km / h  at,.dropped heavy rainfall while near Japan , peaking at 316 mm  on. In Okinawa ,flooded a boat , forcing its occupants to be rescued by the Coast Guard . Also on the island , heavy rainfall caused landslides and flooded houses . In , the storm left 10 people without power . On, wind gusts ofkm / h  damaged about 200 houses . Nationwide ,destroyed 191 homes , injured 9 people , and left about ¥ 300 million  .Towards the end of September , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance eastnortheast of Yap , which became a tropical depression on September 24 . There were initially several, with a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow . After slowing and turning to the northeast , the depression intensified into Tropical Stormon September 26 . After the storm developed a large eye feature , the JTWC upgraded it to typhoon status on September 27 , although the JMA did not follow suit until the following day while near. Also that day ,passed 95 km  west of Iwo Jima , and the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 130 km / h  . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 165 km / h  , before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northeastward . The convection diminished near the center , causingto become extratropical on September 30 . The remnants continued generally northeastward through theIslands , eventually passing south of mainland Alaska on October 7 .On, Typhoonproduced sustained winds of 102 km / h  , with gusts to 200 km / h  , which was the third strongest on record for the station . Rainfall there reached 183 mm  . Wind gusts on Iwo Jima peaked at 109 km / h  .In the middle of October , an area of convection persisted along the monsoon trough between Luzon and Guam , developing into a tropical depression on October 17 . The same monsoon trough later spawned Typhoonto the east . For several days , the system remained disorganized while drifting to the westnorthwest due to weak steering currents south of the subtropical ridge . On October 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm, and by that time the storm had begun drifting to the northeast . With favorable outflow ,quickly intensified into a typhoon on October 20 after developing an eye , and two days later , the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km / h  . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 230 km / h  around the time the welldefined eye had expanded to 37 km  . Subsequently , the typhoon accelerated northeastward into the westerlies and began weakening due to increasing wind shear and dry air . On October 26 ,became extratropical to the east of Japan and dissipated the next day . The passage of the typhoon caused surfacea concentration in the ocean to increase 30fold .The same monsoon trough that spawned Typhoonalso produced an area of convection to the northnortheast of Guam , becoming a tropical depression on October 19 . The system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge . With low wind shear and favorable outflow , the convection became better organized , and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Stormon October 21 . After an eye began to form ,was upgraded to typhoon status the next day . An approaching trough causedto accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow . On October 24 , the JMA estimated peak winds of 175 km / h  while the JTWC estimated winds of 240 km / h  , an unusually high intensity for 30 ° N. Subsequently ,rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the eastsoutheast , beginning a nearly weeklong loop . The cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward .Increasing wind shear weakened the convection , anddeteriorated into a severe tropical storm on October 26 . The next day , it began moving westward while passing about 345 km  north of Wake Island . A large eye of 110 km  in diameter developed , and on October 28 , the JMA reupgradedto typhoon status . The next day , the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough . With decreasing wind shear and warmer waters ,reintensified significantly on October 29 , reaching a secondary peak of 165 km / h  according to JMA , and 215 km / h  according to JTWC . The storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior . Increasing wind shear on October 30 caused rapid weakening , resulting in the eye dissipating . By the next day , the center was exposed , andbecame extratropical , later exiting the basin on November 1 . The remnants weakened , later turning to the southeast and dissipating on November 11 southwest of California .Late in October , an area of convection persisted northwest ofand quickly organized into a tropical depression on October 29 . Moving westnorthwestward toward the Philippines due to a ridge to the east , the depression intensified into Tropical Stormon October 30 . With minimal wind shear , the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye . The JTWC upgradedto typhoon status on October 31 , estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km / h  , although the JMA estimated the storm only attained peak 10 minute winds of 95 km / h  . Early on November 1 ,made landfall on northeastern Luzon in the Philippines , south of. The storm weakened over land and emerged into the South China Sea . By that time , it was moving northward along the periphery of the ridge to the east . On November 2 ,turned to the northeast , passing just east of Taiwan . The next day , it weakened to tropical depression status , and afteroffshore eastern Taiwan ,continued northeastward . It became extratropical on November 5 and dissipated the next day near southern Japan .In the Philippines ,dropped about 150 mm  of rainfall , which flooded the Cagayan River and killed four people . In Taiwan , rainfall reachedmm  inCounty . On the Japanese island of, rainfall totaled 197 mm  , which broke theand daily record for the station in November .A tropical depression developed near Yap on November 11 . The system intensified gradually as it tracked quickly westward toward the Philippines . An anticycloneallowed for strengthening , and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Stormon November 12 . Simultaneously , the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine,and Astronomical Services Administration , which named it Tropical Storm. At around 1600 UTC on November 13 ,made landfall on northernIsland in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west . The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea weakened but quickly reintensified while continuing to the westnorthwest . The JTWC estimated peak winds of 140 km / h  on November 16 , and later that day , the JMA upgraded the storm to typhoon status , estimating peak 10minute winds of 120 km / h  . On November 18 ,passed near southwesternand weakened , with the convection diminishing from the circulation . By the next day , the system weakened to tropical depression status , and dissipated shortly after moving ashore over, China .In the Philippines ,produced strong winds , heavy rainfall , and rough seas . The storm caused widespread power outages and ferry disruptions . According to the PAGASA in its poststorm report , a total of 13 people lost their lives during the storm . On, the storm helped end one of the worst summer droughts in almost 65 years , although it also left heavy crop damage ,64000 ha  of fields and killing 400 head of livestock . With about 800 homes destroyed , damage onamounted to $ 197 million  . Effects were minor in mainland China .Typhoonformed on November 18 from the monsoon trough to the west of the Marshall Islands . Early in its duration , it moved generally to the west or westsouthwest . On November 21 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm, and two days later , it strengthened into a typhoon , developing an eye .later began a prolonged movement to the northwest , during which it passed near several islands in Yap State . The typhoon reached peak intensity on November 26 , with peak 10 – minute sustained winds of 185 km / h  . It later weakened due to a variety of unfavorable conditions , and afterto the northeast ,became extratropical south of Japan on December 2 .Typhoonfirst affectedwith gusty winds , and later it damaged or destroyed about 200 homes inState . There , high waves flooded roads and homes , while high winds damaged crops . Damage was heaviest in Yap State , mostly in the small andIsland . On both islands , the typhoon contaminated the water supply and wrecked the crops . Rainfall reached 263 mm  on, and gusts reached 158 km / h  . Throughout the, damage totaled about $ 17 million , although there were no deaths . The damage prompted thegovernment to declare two states as disaster areas , as well as a disaster declaration from the United States federal government . Whilewas becoming extratropical , it became the first typhoon in December to threaten Japan in 13 years . The storm dropped rainfall that resulted in mudslides and flight.An area of convection formed on May 16 to the southwest of, located within an area of weak wind shear . The next day , the JMA and the JTWC both classified the system as a tropical depression . The convection was disorganized in association with multiple circulation centers , although it gradually organized . Moving westward initially , the depression turned more to the north into an area of increasing wind shear . On May 19 , the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm, and on the same day , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Depression. Soon after , the convection decreased from the center , and by May 20 , all warning agencies had discontinued advisories .On July 9 , PAGASA classified a system as Tropical Depression Falcon , off the west coast of the Philippines . The JMA also briefly initiated advisories before dropping them later on July 9 . Later in the month , PAGASA briefly issued advisories on Tropical Depressionon July 30 off the east coast of. The depression dissipated the next day , causing aboutmillion  in damage . The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north of Luzon on August 18 , with PAGASA naming it. There were severalin the region , with Tropical Stormto the northeast near Taiwan , and the overall system moved generally westward . PAGASA briefly classifiedas a tropical storm on August 19 before ending advisories the next day . The system spread rainfall across China , reaching 824 mm  in,.On September 5 , former Hurricanecrossed the International Date Line into the basin . By that time , the circulation was largely exposed from the convection , and the center quickly dissipated . Later in the month , the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east of the Philippines that PAGASA classified as Tropical Depressionon September 15 . The system moved westward but never intensified , dissipating west of Luzon on September 19 . The broad system also spawned Typhoon.In October , the JTWC classified Tropical Depressionearly in the month off the west coast of Luzon . With weak steering currents , the system moved slowly southwestward beforeto the northwest . On October 10 , the depression dissipated just off the coast of southern China . On October 5 , the JMA monitored a tropical depression southeast of Taiwan that later passed near the island , producing heavy rainfall that peaked at 153 mm  in Ilan County . A few days later , the JTWC monitored Tropical Depression, which developed on October 12 after an extratropical storm produced an area of convection . Described as a subtropical low , the depression moved generally northeastward toward Japan due to an approaching cold front . The depression moved throughandbefore dissipating on October 13 . The depression dropped 285 mm  of rainfall in, while strong winds associated reached 217 km / h  through a stormproduced. The winds knocked over two cranes , killing two people , and left about 9000 homes without power . The depression also killed two people due to. On October 16 , the JMA briefly classified a tropical depression to the east of theIslands . On October 22 , a tropical depression developed in the South China Sea , classified by PAGASA as. The system moved eastward and crossedbefore dissipating on October 24 . In the Philippines , the depression killed one person and caused minor damage . Also in October , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression in the Gulf of Thailand , which moved northwestward and crossed into the Indian Ocean , dropping heavy rainfall in Thailand .In midNovember , the JMA briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near Wake Island . The agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast of Vietnam on December 16 . It finally dissipated on December 17 , with the pressure and winds unknown . The final system of the year was a tropical depression that originated out of the monsoon trough on December 24 east of the Philippines . After initially moving to the west , it turned to the south , and the JTWC estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm . During this time , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm. The system made landfall in northeasternand dissipated on December 27 , bringing heavy rainfall .Within the Northwestern Pacific Ocean , both the Japan Meteorological Agency  and the Philippine,and Astronomical Services Administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific , which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names . The Japan Meteorological Agency 'sTokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization 's Typhoon Committee , should they be judged to have 10minute sustainedof 65 km / h ,  . While the Philippine,and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135 ° E and 115 ° E and between 5 ° N25 ° N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it .

The Battle of , on 11 November 1805 was an engagement in the Napoleonic Wars during the War of the Third Coalition . is located in theValley , on the River, 73 kilometers  upstream from Vienna , Austria . The river makes a crescentshaped curve betweenand nearbyan derand the battle was fought in the flood plain between the river and the mountains .Ata combined force of Russian and Austrian troops trapped a French division commanded by. The French division was part of the newly created VIII Corps , the socalled Corps, under command of . In pursuing the Austrian retreat from,had overextended his three divisions along the north bank of the. Mikhail , commander of the Coalition force , to send's division into a trap and French troops were caught in a valley between two Russian columns . They were rescued by the timely arrival of a second division , under command of Pierrede l. The battle extended well into the night . Both sides claimed victory . The French lost more than a third of their participants , and's division experienced over 40 percent losses . The Austrians and Russians also had heavyto 16perhaps the most significant was the death in action of Johann Heinrich von, one of Austria 's most capable chiefs of staff .The battle was fought three weeks after the Austrian capitulation at Ulm and three weeks before the RussoAustrian defeat at the Battle of. AfterAustria withdrew from the war . The French demanded a high indemnity and Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor , releasing the German states from their allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire .In a series of conflicts from 180315 known as the Napoleonic Wars , various European powers formed five coalitions against the First French Empire . Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution  , these further revolutionized the formation , organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented, mainly due to mass conscription . Under the leadership of Napoleon , French power rose quickly as the Grandeconquered most of Europe , and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 . Napoleon 's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813 – 14 campaigns , resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France . Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815 , known as the Hundred Days , his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo , the pursuit of his army and himself , his abdication and banishment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars .From 180306 the Third Coalition fought the First French Empire and its client states  . Although several naval battles determined control of the seas , the outcome of the war was decided on the continent , predominantly in two major land operations in thevalley : the Ulm campaign in the upperand the Vienna campaign , in the middlevalley .Political conflicts in Vienna delayed Austria 's entry into the Third Coalition until 1805 . After hostilities of the War of the Second Coalition ended in 1801 , emperor 'sadvantage of the subsequent years of peace to develop a military restructuring plan . He carefully put this plan into effect beginning in 1803 – 04 , but implementation was incomplete in 1805 when Karl Mack , Lieutenant Field Marshal and General of the Army , implemented his own restructuring . Mack bypassed Charles ' methodical approach .in the field , Mack 's plan also undermined the overall command andstructure . Regardless , Mack sent an enthusiastic report to Vienna on the military 's readiness . Furthermore , afterNapoleon 's maneuvers in, Mack also reported to Vienna on the weakness of French. His reports convinced the war party advising the emperor , Francis II , to enter the conflict against France , despite Charles ' own advice to the contrary . Responding to the report and rampant antiFrench fever in Vienna , Francis dismissed Charles from his post asand appointed hisbrotherinlaw ,Ferdinand , as commander .The inexperienced Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable Charles , having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment . Although Ferdinand retained nominal command , daytoday decisions were placed in the hands of Mack , equally illsuited for such an important assignment . When Mack was wounded early in the campaign , he was unable to take full charge of the army . Consequently , command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp , Prince of, an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army .The campaign in the uppervalley began in October , with several clashes in. Near the Bavarian town of, 40 kilometers  northwest of, on 8 October the 1st Regiment of, part of's Reserve Cavalry Corps , and grenadiers of' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half its size . The Austrians werein a line and unable to form their defensive squares quickly enough to protect themselves from the 4000and 8000 grenadiers . Nearly 3000 Austrians were captured and over 400 were killed or wounded . A day later , at another small town ,south of the French 59th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over theand ,, chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm .The campaign was not entirely bad news for Vienna . At, Johann vonarranged his 25000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and , on 11 October , the overly confident General of Division Pierrede lattacked's force with fewer than 8000 men . The French lost 1500 men killed and wounded . Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles andof the 15th and 17th,'s force also captured 900 men , 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons . 's victory was a singular success . On 14 October Mack sent two columns out of Ulm in preparation for a breakout to the north : one under Johann headed towardto secure the bridge there , and the other under Franz vonwent north with most of the heavy artillery .the opportunity , Marshal Michel the rest of his VI Corps forward to reestablish contact with, who was still north of the. In a two attacksent one division to the south ofon the right bank of the. This division began the assault at. At the same time another division crossed the river to the east and moved west against's position . After clearing Austrianfrom a bridge , the French attacked and captured a strategically locatedat the top of the hill at bayonet point . The Austrian cavalry unsuccessfully tried to fend off the French , but the Austrian infantry broke and ran . In this engagement alone , the Austrians lost more than half their reserve artillery park , 6000  dead , wounded or captured and four colors .'s column also failed to destroy the bridges across the.Napoleon 's lightning campaign exposed the Austriancommand structure and poor supply apparatus . Mack completelythe Frenchand scattered his forces ; as the French defeated each unit separately , the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications . Napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to 80000 men . At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered hisarmy of 20000 infantry and 3273 cavalry . The officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians , an agreement to which they held .The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna , with the French in close pursuit . A Russian army under Gen. Mikhailalsoaway from the French , withdrawing to the east . At theriver on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by Michael von. On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in. On 7 November the Russians arrived in St.and crossed theriver the next day . Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the, holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein , near the village, until the late afternoon .To the east of Stein , 2 kilometers  down an old road , lay, with its small population of a few hundred , at the confluence of the stream of that name and the. To the west of Stein themade a large curve , creating a crescentshaped floodplain between it and the mountains . At the far western end of the floodplain , where the mountains came down almost to the river 's edge , waswith its castle , known as . The castle had served as a prison for Richard I of England in. In 1645 – 46 , during the Thirty Years War , the Swedes had fortified the castle and then demolished it when they withdrew . It stands at 159 meters  , on the highest ridge of a mountainwithand pinnacles of granite . Because the mountain was sparsely, it was difficult to distinguish the ruins from the rocks .canyons cut through the mountain , and widen into the plain below . Betweenand Stein , on the flood plain , lay the hamlets ofand. Near the hamlets , theflood plain was at its, extending at the most 762 meters  from the base of themountain to the bank of the river .The region was known for its wine . Since the 15th century the local inhabitants practicedand the wine producers formed St. Paul' Guild in, the oldest such guild in the Germanspeaking world .vineyards extended up the sides of theRiver until it became a mountain stream and terrain was unsuitable for cultivation . Theplain supported bothand agriculture . As the terrain became, the vines grew in terraces built from the dark, primordial rock . Fromtothe river makes its wide curve ; the mountains and the steeply terraced slopes prevent clear lineofsight between the two towns .Napoleon had calculated thatwould withdraw toward Vienna , expecting reinforcements from Russia ; he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna , and that this battle would decide the war . Consequently , Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grandeto create a new VIII Corps . This corps was to secure the north shore of the, block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and , more importantly , preventfrom crossing the river and escaping to Russia .The new VIII Corps , under the overall command of , included three infantry divisions and a division of cavalry  . Corps, as it was known , crossed theatandin early November 1805 and marched east , on the north bank of the. Operating independently , the's cavalry conducted reconnaissance ahead of them and on the flanks . Gen.'s division  took the lead ;was with them . They were followed by Gen.'s division  about one day 's march behind . JeanBaptiste's division  , marching another day behind, brought up the rear . A flotilla of 50 boats acquired atprovided communications across the. Before sendingon his mission , Napoleon instructed him to protect his north flank at all times against possible Russian reinforcements , advice he reiterated in subsequent written orders . Napoleon also advisedto secure allof thebetweenand Vienna .On 9 November's division reachedan derand covered the 50 kilometers  toby early on the following afternoon . Here itwith some Russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them . Feeling confident , the French established a forward post just upstream from Stein . Initselfset up his command post and directed the establishment of a small field hospital . Although the position seemed secure , he had ignored Napoleon 's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left  flank .This failure was an important factor whenlost his corps ' socalled " eyes " : after he andhad crossed the, the Frenchhadto the northwest , leaving only three squadrons of the 4thavailable for reconnaissance . These had left the division and were operating independently of's command . Consequently ,andmarchedthrough the narrow canyon west of, not knowing what lay ahead of them .had led the Coalition army across theat, a short distance past Stein , and destroyed the bridge behind him . His actions deprived the French commanders of a possible route across the, putting the deployment of the entire French division at further risk in the case of retreat . In this decisionabandoned Vienna to the French , who wereon the Austrian capital from the north , west and southwest , for the security of uniting with reinforcements from.chose a military solution over a political one .Unknown to eitheror, the Coalition had concentrated a force of approximately 24000 men  within a few kilometers of the French position at. In comparison ,'s division had only 6000 men . The AustroRussian force was a mixture of infantry , , Russianand Russian and Austrian cavalry , accompanied by more than 68 artillery pieces ., who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary Russian , had overall command . The Russian cavalry , units of the greatly feared Cossacks , were wellsuited for patrolling the river bank ; indeed , on 9 November they had taken 40 French soldiers as prisoners . Furthermore , reinforcements stood in Moravia , less than two weeks ' march away . If the main body of the French army crossed the river , they would require time to prepare .would have ample warning of any largescale French movement .After the afternoon 's initialwith the French ,held a council of war on the evening of 10 November at, at the greatthere . He knew several things . First , he knew the positions of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured . He also knew thathad crossed atand was well ahead of any French reinforcements :had crossed atand , by 10 November , stood at, 50 kilometers  upstream , andwas another 7 kilometers  further behind him .knew the size of the Frenchdivisionits positions , and he knew that most of thewere not covering the French flank but had turned north . He also knew , or had made a good, about Napoleon 's orders , so he knew what to offerandas bait .In addition to the Russian generals , the council included Austrian commanders Lieutenant Field Marshal Johann Heinrich vonand Friedrich Karl Wilhelm ,., who had retired from the military in 1800 , had been recalled into service after the Ulmand had come tohighly recommended by the Emperor . He was an experiencedand strategist and had served in a variety of posts in the Habsburg military ; he had beenCharles ' trusted adviser during the campaigns from 1796 to 1800 and had assisted in planning several of Charles ' victories . Upon his recall ,was appointed Chief of theGeneral Staff of the Coalition Army . The generals had found among the Austrian force oneChristoph Freiherr von , who had knowledge of the local geography .Together ,,and the other generals , with von's advice on the local terrain ,a plan to encircle the French at. Russian commander Mikhail would approach's division from the east , supported by 's corps , and pin the French in place . Three additional columns , commanded by  ,Gen.and, would outflank the French from the west and the north . They would offer , as bait , a rumor : the Russian army was retreating into Moravia and only a rearguard would be left at.On the night of 10 – 11 November a Russian column under's command began its passage through the narrow canyons , intent on arriving atby noon ; two more columns , underand, moved in wider, planning to pass through the mountains and attack the French , who were extended along the river bank . According to the plan , in late morning's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right . This flanking attack , combined with's frontal assault from Stein , would force the French into a;, they would have no option but todie . To ensure the success of the plan , the second and third columns , underand, would arrive in early and midafternoon and support the earlier assaults . In this way , even if the French tried to retreat west to, they would not escape the like grip of the Coalition army . accepted the bait of aRussian retreat . In the early morning of 11 November he anddeparted fromto seize Stein and,the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rearguard behind . As they approached Stein , a column of's troops attacked the French forward positions .this force was theRussian rear guard ,ordered Gen.to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein . Fighting spread though the villages of,and the farm at. Instead of withdrawing , as a rear guard would , more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column .Initiallymade rapid progress , but he quickly recognized that the opposing force was much stronger than the typical rear guard of a retreating army . Realizing he had beenand that's troops were tiring rapidly ,sent orders to's division toforward . By midmorning the French momentum had stalled ;committed most of his remaining forces to drivingback , leaving a single300cover his northern flank , and sent the rest to attack the Russian right . Within 30 minutes he achieved the superiority of numbers he sought . His 4500 French opposed 2600 Russians and forced them back toward Stein while pressing an attack along the river .had no option , for neither's nor's flanking columns were to be seen .At this stage of the battle fighting paused .andwaited for's arrival whileandwaited for's and's .'s column was expected to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance . The timing of the respite varies , depending on whose reports are consulted : fighting paused at around 12 : 00 or 14 : 00 .arrived first and immediately assaulted's line with three battalions , pushing the French out of. Caught between two strong forces ,attempted to push his way back through, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops .through the narrowcanyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear ,and his division were trapped when more of's Russians appeared to block their retreat . The narrowhampered the Russians ;'s men had to march out of the canyons , form ranks and attack in waves . Despite's continuous assault in the next two to three hours ,andpushed the Russians back up the narrowin the hillside . At this point ,'s column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle . The French were outnumbered more than three to one , assaulted in the front by's column , in the middle by's and in the rear by.Earlier in the morninghad proceeded with his column south and east along the river , from, according to instructions . Even before the arrival of's, he heard the sound of artillery in the distance and sent riders ahead to discover the cause . They came back to report that a Russian column  was descending from the mountains to take the road to. Realizing this would separate him from the forward division , his troops toward the sound of battle and deployed them to take the Russians in the flank . The French assault , heralded by cannon fire , caused's troops to turn their attention from'sforce to face these new. Although superior in numbers ,'s column had no supporting artillery , and the narrow space prevented them from taking advantage of their size . It was's turn to face attackers at his front and rear , until the arrival of's column , which hadits way through the mountains in the west . arrived at dusk , and the action continued well after dark ; in midNovember night falls at close to 17 : 00 in the upper . Despite the darkness ,descended out of theand deployed his troops to 's flank . As his Russians entered the, they came between a battalion of French and another of Russians . With the additional force , the French were overwhelmed , but most of the shooting subsided when the combatants could not tell apart friend fromin the dark . Under the cover of darkness ,used the French flotilla to evacuate his exhausted troops to the south bank . The French and Russians continued to into the night asencountered one another in the dark .of's force provided any necessary rear guard action , and the following morning the remaining men were evacuated from the north shore of the, while they maintained possession of onlyandon the north bank .The losses were:lost close to 40 percent of his division to death and wounds . Aside from losing five guns , 47 officers and 895 men under his command were captured , bringing the loss ofcloser to 60 percent ; furthermore , he lost the eagles of the 4th Infantry Regiment  and the eagle andof the 4th. The Russians lost around 4000 , about 16 percent of their force , and two regimental colors . The Austrian Lieutenant Field Marshalwas killed as the battle concluded , probably by Russianin the confused melee . The vineyards and the villages ofandwere destroyed , as was most ofand Stein .was heavily damaged ; the French plundered the town at least twice , and "handled " its inhabitants .Both sides claimed victory . Although losses were fairly equal in terms ofwounded or dead on eachCoalition forces went into battle with 24000 men while the French started with's division of about 6000 , which grew close to 8000 when's men joined the fighting in the afternoon . Regardless ,'s division was nearly destroyed ; the 30 percent losses experienced by the French fell predominantly on his division .for both sides , the fighting was hard . The weather had been cold ; an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways , and" like chandeliers " hung from the trees .For the Coalition , the Russians were secure on the north bank of the, awaiting reinforcements from; the bridges betweenand Vienna had been destroyed , making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult , but not impossible . After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news , the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory . The French had retreated from the field with a badlydivision andhad secured the right flank . Indeed , Francis was so pleased with the outcome atthat he awardedthe Military Order of Maria.For the French , the survival of the Corpsseemed nothing short of a miracle . The remainder of's division crossed the river the next morning and eventuallyin Vienna , which the French acquired by deception later in the month . More importantly for them , the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions . Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft . They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at,their boats .into the icy river , most had drowned . Despite this initial panic ,'s column retained its cohesion , and responded well to various difficult demands .had demonstrated his tactical: when he heard cannon fire , he directed his troops toward it to support the French division . In terms of French staffing ,'s failure to guard his flank , especially in the face of Napoleon 's direct advice , adversely influenced his relationship with his commander . However , in the immediate weeks ahead , the flamboyantdid more to annoy Napoleon thanhad . In assessing the battle and its aftermath , historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only onand: " Napoleon , aware of's danger and his ownfor it , vented his frustration on, whom he unjustly accused of abandoningfor the empty glory of riding through Vienna . "After the victory at, Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and reassigned. However disappointed he may have been with, Napoleon was pleased with's performance . As recognition of his conduct in what the French called " the immortal Battle of" ,received the Officer 's Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor .The loss ofwas a significant blow to the Austrian military organization . Called out of retirement for this specific task , he was one of their most experienced general staff officers , other than theCharles . From the summer of 1796 until his retirement in 1800 he had been Chief of theGeneral Staff of the Army , the Lower Rhine , the Rhine and the Army of Germany . Furthermore , he was a trusted member ofCharles ' staff .

In the Ulm campaign , the Habsburgs achieved some minor victories , such as's at, but ultimately lost an entire army and an officer corps . The latter would not resume arms against France until formally exchanged . This condition crippled the Austrian military leadership and forced the recall of such pensioners asout of retirement . After the capitulation at Ulm , isolated portions of the Austrian militarycapture and joined with their Russian allies ; Michael von's corps slipped out of theand joined's force . A few other small forces refused toand seemingly melted into the Bavarian mountains and theforests , to reappear in Bohemia for. Sixteen hundred cavalry , includingFerdinand and Prince, broke out of Ulm before its capitulation . Maximilian , Count of, led his column back through the mountains into Austria , fighting rear guard actions against pursuing French forces at the and.

In 1741 , during the War of the Austrian, several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies , intent on capturing Vienna , by painting drain pipes to look like cannons , and beating on drums , thus suggesting the presence of a large force .After 1805 , the exploits of 40000 French , Russian , and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination .

The house in which Captain vonlived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle . In 1840 , a Spanishcreated an image of the battle , which was later expanded by EnglishJohn. The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via theflotilla  on anight . In fact , the moon was in its last quarter phase 48 hours later , and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image .In 1836 , Jean AntoineFort  , a historical painter , created aof the battle , Combat dele 111805  Battle ofof 11 November 1805 ) , which is in thecollection at Versailles .In the Russian novel War and Peace , Leodevoted several pages to the battle , its prelude , and its aftermath , and the delivery of its news to the Tsar by Prince Andrew .

They are the original and simplestproduced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components . Historically , they are the firstthat could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections . However , they are rarely considered for a modern design , the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response .Constant kwere invented by George Campbell . He published his work in 1922 , but had clearly invented thesome time before , as his colleague at AT & T Co , Otto, was already making improvements to the design at this time . Campbell 'swere far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously . Campbell called hiselectric wave, but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others . Many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented ; an early  variation was the mderived filter bywho coined the term constant k for the Campbell filter in order to distinguish them .The great advantage Campbell 'shad over thecircuit and other simpleof the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection orof transition between pass band and stop band . It was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained .Thewere designed by Campbell for the purpose of separatingtelephone channels on transmission lines , but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that . The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded . However , the ladderused by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today withof modern filter designs such as thefilter . Campbell gave constant k designs for lowpass , highpass and bandpass. Bandstop and multiple bandare also possible .Some of theterms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below . Image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of twoport sections , and in the case of thebeing discussed , an infinite ladder network of Lsections . Here " L " should not be confused with theL – in electronic filter, " L " refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter " L " .The sections of the hypothetical infinite filter are made of series elements having andelements with . The factor of two is introduced for mathematical convenience , since it is usual to work in terms of halfsections where it disappears . The imageof the input and output port of a section will generally not be the same . However , for a midseries section  will have the same imageon both ports due to symmetry . This imageis designateddue to the " T "of a midseries section . Likewise , the imageof a mid section is designateddue to the "". Half of such a " T " or "" section is called a halfsection , which is also an Lsection but with half the element values of the full Lsection . The imageof the halfsection ison the input and output ports : on the side presenting the series element it is equal to the midseries, but on the side presenting theelement it is equal to the mid. There are thus two variant ways of using a halfsection .Parts of this article or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complexrepresentation ofandand on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals .The building block of constant kis the halfsection " L " network , composed of a seriesZ , and aThe " k " in " constant k " is the value given by ,<formula>Thus , k will have units of, that is ,. It is readily apparent that in order for k to be constant , Y must be the dualof Z. A physical interpretation of k can be given by observing that k is the limiting value ofas the size of the section  approaches zero , while keeping k at its initial value . Thus , k is the characteristic,, of the transmission line that would be formed by thesesmall sections . It is also the imageof the section at resonance , in the case of bandpass, or at= 0 in the case of lowpass. For example , the pictured lowpass halfsection has<formula> .Elements L and C can be madesmall while retaining the same value of k . Z and Y however , are both approaching zero , and from the formulae  for image,<formula> .See also Image# The imageof the section are given by<formula>and<formula>Given that the filter does not contain anyelements , the imagein the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary . For example , for the pictured lowpass halfsection ,<formula>The transition occurs at a cutoff frequency given by<formula>Below this frequency , the imageis real ,<formula>Above the cutoff frequency the imageis imaginary ,<formula>The transmission parameters for a general constant k halfsection are given by<formula>and for a chain of n halfsections<formula>For the lowpass Lshape section , below the cutoff frequency , the transmission parameters are given by<formula>That is , the transmission isin the passband with only the phase of the signal changing . Above the cutoff frequency , the transmission parameters are :<formula>The presented plots of image,and phase change correspond to a lowpass prototype filter section . The prototype has a cutoff frequency of 1. This is produced by a filter halfsection withL1. This prototype can bescaled and frequency scaled to the desired values . The lowpass prototype can also be transformed into highpass , bandpass or bandstop types by application of suitable frequency.Several Lshape halfsections may beto form a composite filter . Likemust always face like in these combinations . There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical Lshaped halfsections . Where a port of image faces another, the section is called asection . Wherefacesthe section so formed is a T section . Further additions of halfsections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series orelements .It should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image. This is usually not true of the sections at either end , which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance . The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the prediction will become , since the effects of the terminatingare masked by the intervening sections . " The" is an episode of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on Christmas Day 2012 on BBC One . It is the eighth Christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul.The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor  brooding with the assistance ofMadame , her wife Jenny Flint  and  , after the loss of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams in the previous episode , " The Angels Take Manhattan " . He is forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious , sentientthat are building themselves and meetsOswald  , a governess also investigating the. They discover that theare being animated by the Great Intelligence  with the help of a man named Dr .Building upon the character 's surprise introduction in " Asylum of the" , " The" introducesas the Doctor 's new companion , though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the Doctor starting with " The Bells of Saint John " . In addition to, " The" also introduces a redesigned, revised title sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor 's costume . The special was produced in August 2012 , with location filming in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 987 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth mostwatched programme of Christmas Day . " The" was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character ofwell . However , some felt that Grant andwereas villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation .To promote the special , threewere released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Needon 16 November 2012 , titled " The Great Detective " . TheMadame, her human wife Jenny Flint , and the  describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective . The fourth detective reveals himself to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired .A second prequel , titled " " , was released online on 17 December 2012 . At the end of a case ,and Jennywith an officer from Scotland Yard andfor's violent wishes for the's punishment .explains's alien origin as well as her own to the officer , much to his.reveals that she wasby an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans , though that changed when she fell in love with Jenny . On the carriage ride home , Jenny notices it is beginning to snow andnotes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky .A third prequel , titled " The Battle of Demon 's Run — Two Days Later " was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013 . Two days after the events of " A Good Man Goes to War " ,and Jenny convincethat he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London . The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask howwas resurrected and came to be in's employ .In 1842 England , a young boy builds a, but refuses to play with the other children . Thestarts speaking to the boy , repeating histhat the other children are silly . Fifty years later , the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter, proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute . He hires men to collect samples of snow , which he places in a large snowfilled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated. The Doctor , stillafter losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams , has parked hisabove Victorian London among the clouds . He uses his allies, Jenny , andto keep people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city .Elsewhere ,Oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by . He attempts to leave discreetly , butfollows him to a coach . Not wishing to become involved in matters , the Doctor instructsto bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of's memories with just a touch . Before they can do so , they are surrounded bycreated from snow with psychic properties who attack the group . The Doctor realises that's thoughts are creating theand ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting . the Doctor that if heher memory , she will forget how to deal with the. The Doctorallows her to go anda staircase to the sky to return to the.follows him and knocks on the door , but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers .returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain. She learns that's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead .realises that the pond that contains the old governess ' body is the only thing still frozen around them . She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny , who takes her to see.tellsshe gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help .chooses the word " Pond " , whichthe Doctor andhis interest .Acting on a tip from, the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes . He confronts Dr.and find a large glass globe in's office that contains psychic snow . The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence , the entity that has been speaking to Dr.since he was a boy . He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling theand has taken interest in's pond . The Doctor visits the pond andthat the Great Intelligence is using the old governess ' body as a DNAto form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt . Whileis putting the children to bed , the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house . The Doctor fights her off and is joined by, Jenny and. Dr.arrives with moreand tells them he wants the governess ' ice body . The Doctor flees withto the roof of the mansion and then to the overhead . They are pursued by the ice governess , whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals . Inside thethe Doctor givesakey , but the ice governess arrives and pullsdown off the cloud .The Doctor picks upand takes her back to's mansion , placing her under medical care of. He collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in aLondon Undergroundtin . He andtravel to's lab , where the Doctor notes the Intelligence 's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary DNA . Dr the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm , whichon to him . The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence , which has been existing as a mirror of Dr's thoughts , will vanish with theof's memories . Instead , the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control's body , which it uses to attackand the Doctor . The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly, andfalls dead . Outside , a saltwater rain has started , and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence : thefamily , crying for.informs the Doctor upon his return to themansion thatonly has moments left , and she passes away as the Doctor returns thekey to her . At her funeral , the Doctor reads's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in " Asylum of the" who became a, whom he refers to as "Girl " . Heannounces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and , bidding farewell to his allies for now , the Doctor departs in theto investigate and find. The episode concludes in contemporary times , where a young woman resemblingwalks through the same graveyard ,by's tombstone .The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The  , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear  , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robotas its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in " The" when he presents the London Undergroundtin to the Great Intelligence in Dr's laboratory ; the Intelligence states , " I do not understand these markings " , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a " key strategic weakness in metropolitan living " , referring to  the futureattack on London via the Underground .Coleman previously playedOswald in " Asylum of the" , though the connection between the two characters is not clarified untilreveals she has an interest in, a trait that's character also had . The Doctor , after meeting,replies " those were the days " when she asks why he isn 't staying to get acquainted with her , which are the same words he tells Craig when Craig comments that the Doctor always wins . The final scenes at the graveyard establish thatshares the same name as, leading the Doctor tothey are the same person . As seen on her gravestone ,'sis 23 November , the date Doctor Who was first transmitted in 1963 .Writer Steven Moffat stated that he wanted an " epic " quality to the Christmas special . The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous companions ; Moffat said that " I think he 's probably reached the point in his life where he 's saying , ' Friendship for me is just postponed— I want to be on my own for a while ' . " Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor  in 1963 and theDoctor  in 2005 . He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s , but rejected by the production team at the time . Continuing the theme introduced with the series ' first five episodes , " The" was promoted like a movie . A movie poster was released in the Radio Times , showing the Doctor andascending the ladder to the.The episode saw several major design changes for the series . " The" is the debut of a redesignedinterior , as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune . The new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the Doctor 's face , the first time since Survival , the final serial of the classic series in 1989 , that the Doctor 's face has been seen in the title sequence . Moffat had noticed that the' design was getting " progressively whimsical " and resembled more of a " magical place " rather than a machine . It was designed by series production designer Michael, who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be " darker and" and provide an easier access to the " gallery " of the ship when shooting .The Doctor also wears a oneoff costume , Victorianthemed , which Smith described as " a bit meets the Doctor " . Moffat described the new outfit as a " progression " as the Doctor was in " a different phase of his life now " and felt more " grownup " and. The costume was designed by Howardfor this episode . " The" also contains several references to Sherlock Holmes , including the Doctor dressing up as him . Moffat is cocreator of the BBC series Sherlock , for which Smith auditioned for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor . In addition , the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the Sherlock theme .This episode marks the return of JennaLouise Coleman , who previously appeared in the series opener , " Asylum of the" . Coleman was cast because of her chemistry with Matt Smith , and especially because she was able to talk faster than him . She auditioned for the role of, notfrom " Asylum " , as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to Moffat whilst casting for. The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep Coleman 's appearance a secret until " Asylum " was broadcast ; the effort was ultimately successful . Moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made " the show feel different " and brought the story to " a new beginning " with a different person meeting the Doctor . Smith said thatwas different from her predecessor Amy Pond  , which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor . Coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated , citing the reason for following the Doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers . Thewho would become a travelling companion of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring premiere , " The Bells of Saint John " ; save for a brief cameo at the end of " The" . Coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with " trust that there would be a payoff " to her mystery .Also returning to the series are Neveas Madame, DanasandStewart as Jenny . All three previously appeared in " A Good Man Goes to War " and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the. They returned due to the popularity ofand Jenny ; Moffat considered a spinoff featuring them , though he did not have the time to do it . Instead , he decided to bring them back in the main series . Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions , as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse ofDeath , which was written by Moffat and as an alternativeDoctor in the animated story Scream of thewhich had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005 . Smith commented that Grant was " born to be a Who villain . He pitches it on that perfect level and tone " . Grant 's appearance in Doctor Who wasby the BBC via Twitter , announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012 . Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script , and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme . The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian. The two childrenis governess to ,and, were played by reallife brother and sister Joseph and Ellie Alden ." The" was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character ; however , it did not begin filming until the week of 6 August 2012 , after Coleman had worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing the Christmas special . The readthrough had taken place on 2 August 2012 . This was the first Christmas special to be filmed in BBC Wales ' newLock studios . Scenes featuring Coleman and several guest stars in a Victorian setting were filmed in Newport , Wales , while Coleman and Smith were also spotted filming in Bristol two weeks later on 21 August . Some scenes which used snow props were filmed in Portland Square , Bristol , where filming took place overnight on 21 – 22 August 2012 .

No. 20 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force  support squadron . Coming under the control of No. 96 Wing , it is responsible for the management of the airfield at RAAF Base, South Australia . The squadron originated as a maritime patrol unit during World War II .in August 1941 , it operated and Short Empire flying boats from bases in New Guinea , Queensland and the Northern Territory , conducting searchandrescue , minelaying , antisubmarine and bombing missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre . Following the conclusion of hostilities , the squadron was disbanded in March 1946 . It was reactivated as an airfield support squadron in April 2015 .No. 20 Squadron was formed at Port Moresby , New Guinea , on 1 August 1941 for a general reconnaissance role , under the command of Squadron LeaderGibson . Its establishment was six flying boats and 133 personnel , but only five aircraft  and 55 personnel were available initially . The squadron conducted longrange patrols between bases scattered around the islands to Australia 's north in conjunction with No. 11 Squadron . On 18 November , No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas were augmented by two Short Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron .On 25 November 1941 , following the loss ofSydney , one of No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas was despatched to Western Australia to join a No. 11 Squadronin searchandrescue missions , but they found only oil. By the outbreak of war in the Pacific , No. 20 Squadron had a strength of six Catalinas and two Empire flying boats . Its personnel at the beginning of December numbered 14 officers and 118 men . The squadron undertook its first sortie of the Pacific War on 8 December ; alocated three Japanesein the vicinity of Thursday Island , Queensland . Later in the month it commenced antisubmarine patrols and , in January 1942 , bombing raids against Japanese bases . As the Japanese advanced into the South West Pacific , No. 20 Squadron was also responsible for evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion . On 21 January , one of its Catalinas located the Japanese fleet steaming for Rabaul and signalled a warning to the town 's Australian defenders before being shot down by antiaircraft fire ; it was the squadron 's first combat loss .In the wake of the fall of Rabaul , the Catalinas of Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons became the RAAF 's only offensive weapon against the Japanese . Their raids on Rabaul did little to stem the Japanese advance , and in the following months Port Moresby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks , which destroyed aircraft , facilities , and squadron records . In February 1942 , the Shortoperated by Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons were transferred to the newly formed No. 33  Squadron . No. 20 Squadron lost two Catalinas during patrols on 4 and 6 May ; the nine crewmen of the first were later found to have been captured and beheaded ; the crew of the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace .In response to the threat of invasion at Port Moresby , Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons moved to Bowen , Queensland , on 7 May 1942 . They were soon attacking Japanese targets in Lae ,and Rabaul . On 27 June , each squadron contributed an aircraft to a fourhour raid over Lae andduring which , as well as bombs , the RAAF crews dropped beer bottles to disrupt the enemy soldiers ' sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was , according to the official history , " something between awhistle and a scream " . By 1 July , No. 20 Squadron 's strength was six Catalinas and 175 personnel , out of a planned establishment of nine aircraft and 415 personnel . Its prime responsibility in early 1942 was maritime reconnaissance as far as New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , and New Caledonia ; the latter half of the year saw a greater focus on night bombing . Now comprising 252 officers and men , the squadron relocated to Cairns on 11 November 1942 . From Cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance , antisubmarine and occasional bombing operations over the waters around New Guinea . Between December 1942 and March 1943 , No. 20 Squadron 's aircraft flew a total of 9 hours and dropped 227 tons of bombs . The squadron 's role changed in June 1943 when it commenced minelaying operations over the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines , though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops .In September 1944 , No. 20 Squadron became part of No. 76 Wing RAAF , along with Nos. 42 and 43 Squadrons , and moved to Darwin , Northern Territory . All three squadrons operated Catalinas , their primary purpose being minelaying . On the night of 30 September , aof No. 20 Squadron was shot down while attacking a ship atin the Dutch East Indies ; the loss was compounded by the fact that one of theof the mining campaign , Lieutenant CommanderCarr of the Royal Australian Navy , was aboard the plane and was captured by the Japanese . Another of the squadron 's Catalinas went down on the night of 27 / 28 January 1945 , possibly in a cyclone over the Timor Sea , during the campaign to mine. In March , a detachment of four No. 20 Squadron aircraft , along with four from No. 43 Squadron , laid mines off the coast of southern China andas part of a No. 76 Wing offensive in this area ; these operations were conducted fromGulf in the Philippines . One of No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas was lost on the night of 7 / 8 March , most likely owing to bad weather rather than enemy action . Three of the squadron 's aircraft mined the entrance to Hong Kong harbour on 8 April and , on 26 May , four of its Catalinas minedharbour in China , thenorth that any Australian aircraft infiltrated during the war in the Pacific . Three of its aircraft flew the RAAF 's last minelaying mission on 30 July .No. 20 Squadron 's final wartime sortie was a patrol on 14 August 1945 . Following the end of the war , the squadron operated in the transport role and ferried Australian prisoners of war home from various locations in South East Asia . It relocated to RAAF Station, New South Wales , on 21 November . No. 20 Squadron flew its last mission , a transport flight to, on 21 January 1946 , and disbanded aton 27 March .No. 20 Squadron was reactivated on 1 April 2015 to support airfield operations at RAAF Base, South Australia .of ninepersonnel and one Australian Public Service member under the command of Squadron Leader Simon Bartlett , the squadron formed part of No. 96 Wing , a component of Combat Support Group  . The airfield had previously been managed under the auspices ofOperational Support Group , but a commandandcontrol review commissioned by the Chief of Air Force recommended that , in common with other RAAF airfields , it should be administered by. RAAF Base, incorporatingVillage , was one of two Air Force units formally established on 12 January 2015 as part of a reorganisation of theRange Complex , the other unit being RAAFTest Range .The design of the reactivated squadron 's crest includes a wedgetailed eagle to denote courage and nobility , aspearto symbolise the town and its indigenous heritage , Sturt 's Desertto represent South Australia , and thestar cluster , which features in the folklore of the localpeople . The Light Tank Mk VII  , also known as the, was a British light tank produced by Vickers in the late 1930s and deployed during the World War II . Thewas originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army . It improved upon its predecessor , the MkLight Tank , by introducing the extra firepower of a 2pounder gun . The War Office ordered 70 tanks , an order that eventually increased to 220 . Production was delayed by several factors , and as a consequence , only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced .The tank 's design flaws , combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions , ruled out the use ofin the North African Campaign . As a result , the majority of the tanks remained in Britain , although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of theprogram . In early 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations , one of which was equipped with. In May 1942 , a small number offormed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar , and , in June 1942 ,were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an airportable light tank to support British airborne forces . Thewere transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraftgliders . A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 ; instead they were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment .The division used approximately 20during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944 . The tanks were successfully landed by glider , but they did not perform well . Several were lost in accidents , and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces . A few days after the beginning of the operation , the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support . By August 1944 , most of thein action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks , and the remainder were replaced by the in December 1944 . did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946 ; the last was retired in 1950 . There were several variations on thedesign , including theselfpropelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII , but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army .The prototype of the Light Tank Mk VII  , nicknamed '' , was first developed in 1937 by Vickers as a private venture , and was intended to be sold either to the British Army or to foreign militaries . It was to be the latest in a series of light tanks produced by the company . The tank was designed to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient armament in earlier light tanks that were fitted only with machine guns . VickersArmstrong installed on the Mka 2pounder 40millimetre  main gun paired with a 792millimetre machine gun , and mounted the two guns in a twoman turret . The tank possessed a maximum of 14 millimetres  of armour . The prototype weighed approximately 16800 pounds  and was powered by a 165horsepower  Meadows engine .was on eight road wheels , four per side , with no separate driver orwheels and it was capable of a 40 miles per hour  top speed . The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system incorporated into earlier Vickers models . The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns bythe tracks . For sharper turns , the system returned to the conventional method ofone track to turn the tank ; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on theand reduce its power. The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air forandof oil for, and each of the wheels was independently sprung .The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the model was tested as a possible " light cruiser " since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . Despite this , it was decided that it was essential for someto be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program . Accordingly , the War Office gave thethe official General Staff specification number, and , in November 1938 , accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank 's range .The number to be produced was subject toas the War Officein their demand ; in July 1938 , it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced , then increased the request to 120 after a threeday conference in November . Production was to begin in July 1940 , but meanwhile the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100 . The number further increased to 220 after MetropolitanCarriage and, a company part owned by VickersArmstrong that would be producing the tanks , indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks .Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a postBattle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle . Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to reevaluate the suitability of the light tank design . The prewar role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better crosscountry abilities . Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled .The cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177 . The name '' was given to the Mk VII , on 22 September 1941 , on the orders of the War Office . The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year .The War Office and the Army were concluding , at this point , that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat , and thewas considered to be obsolete . This decision may have marked the end for thein active service ; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat .The demise ofwas prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid1941 , as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain 's fledgling airborne forces , formed in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill . When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces , officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an integral component ; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment , which , by 1941 , was to include artillery and some form of tank . Plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions , but , by May 1941 , the feasibility of a 55 metric tons  tank to be carried for 350 miles  in a glider was accepted , although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task . In a conference held on 16 January 1941 , it was decided that the General Aircraft, currently under development , would be used to transport a singletank or two Universal. Thewas chosen because it was an obsolete design , and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces .Beginning in January 1944 , training exercises were conducted carrying theand their crews insidegliders . These exercises were successful ; during the training by ' C ' Squadron of thePilot Regiment , which specialised in flying the, over 2800were made with an average of 50per crew . Only three incidents resulted in fatalities or injuries , with seven pilots killed during the training . When thewas redesignated as an airborne tank , several changes were made to its design . A number of tanks had their 2 pounder guns replaced with a 762millimetre  infantry support howitzer ; these tanks were then designated as1 . Additionally , were added to thosewhich still possessed their 2 pounders to increase their muzzle velocity and armour penetration .Theexperienced several setbacks throughout its development and deployment with the Army and airborne forces . One of the major problems was the limited number of these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942 , which particularly affected the airborne forces . The transport of 20 of the tanks to the USSR under theAct depleted the number available for use by airborne forces , as did the loss of several more during Operation, the invasion of Madagascar . A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that approximately 50were available for use . In a memorandum , dated January 1943 , by Major General George F., commander of the 1st Airborne Division ,complained that he had been informed that 70 of the tanks were available , whereas only 50 actually remained , with no reserves to replace those lost in combat . This lack of sufficient replacement reserves , combined with a War Office report that someairborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India , led to the's eventual replacement by the US .A number of design faults of thewere revealed through its operational use . Its size limited the possible crew to three , a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to operate theeffectively . The gunner or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act asfor the 2 pounder , which caused delays in combat . A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop ofduring combat would be almost impossible .Problems were also found with the fitted to the 2pounder to increase its range and penetration power ; after they had been fitted thecould not be removed , and could only fire specially designed armourpiercing rounds , which took time to manufacture .The War Office also considered the's cooling system faulty , making the tank unsuitable for service inclimates , such as the Middle East and North Africa .The firstwere delivered to the Army in November 1940 , and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division  and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division . However , the faults discovered with thecooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign . Shortly after , all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service .Theremained in Britain , and would probably have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service , but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR , Operation Barbarossa began , and the USSR became an ally of Britain . Theprogram , begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China , was therefore extended to the USSR . As part of the program , the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR , which in early 1942 , included a shipment of 20, as well as a number of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks . The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British , and so could use the. When the tanks arrived in the USSR , however , it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions ; additionally , the cold weather had aeffect on the tank 's suspension and tracks . Additional testing of thewas conducted by the Soviet military and the design was admired for its,, and speed , as well its ability to run on lowquality fuel , unlike contemporary Soviet designs . Theof the's armour was found to be a problem and one which could not be solved , as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank 's speed . Despite these drawbacks in the's design , Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T70 light tank in use at the time , and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat . A number ofwere sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle , and in September 1943 two were assigned to the Tank Battalion , which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade ; both tanks were destroyed in combat , one on 30 September and the other on 2 October , the latter a casualty of artillery fire . Several were also used for propaganda purposes , appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in theregion .In mid1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations , known as ' A ' , ' B ' and ' C ' Special Service Squadrons . Both ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Marklight tanks , but ' C ' Squadron was equipped with twelvetransferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade , 1st Armoured Division . On 31 July 1941 , ' C ' Squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate . All three squadrons were transported toin Scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation andfrom ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations . In early September , elements of ' C ' Squadron , including six, formed part of a force which sailed for Freetown in West Africa ; during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany , and the force wasto capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred . These fears proved, and in March 1942 , the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training .The next assignment , Operation, was the invasion of Madagascar , the third largest island in the world and then underFrench control . The Prime Minister and the Combined Chiefs of Staff decided that Madagascar should be occupied as rapidly as possible to deny the port ofto Japanese naval forces , which had recently advanced into the Indian Ocean . Operationwas under the command of Major General Robert G.and consisted of No. 5 Commando , 29th Independent Brigade Group , and the 17th and 13th brigade groups from 5th Infantry Division . The 29th Brigade formed the core of the invasion force due to its training in amphibious operations , and under its command was ' B ' Special Service Squadron , created bysixfrom ' B ' Squadron and sixfrom ' C ' Squadron into a single unit . The squadron was formed into four troops , one Headquarters troop of threeand one, one of four, and two formed from the remaining five. The invasion force assembled off the west coast of the northern tip of Madagascar on 4 May , nearand the bay of Diego. The invasion plan called for an amphibious assault landing on four beaches on the west side of the tip , which would allow the British forces to advance approximately 20 miles  and approachfrom the rear . Information about the landing beaches , the defences possessed by the port , and theFrench defending forces was limited and vague , although it was believed that the defenders had no weapons capable of penetrating the armour of a Valentine tank .The landings began at 04 : 30 on 5 May , with 5 Commando landing atBay and the three infantry brigades and ' B ' Squadron landing atBay . The objective of the infantry brigades and their armoured support was to take control ofand a nearby town , but although the infantry landed successfully , ' B ' Squadron had more trouble ; the area of beach designated for its landing craft was blocked for several hours after acame loose from a landing craft and became stuck in the sand . The infantry brigades advanced towardwithout the squadron , but eventually twoand a singlewere dispatched in support , catching up with the lead elements of the infantry near the town of. Here the invasion force encountered the first French defences , consisting of camouflaged trenches anddug in along a ridge . The tanks attempted to breach them , but the rocky ground madedifficult and they could not close with theand trenches ; they engaged a number of targets with 2 pounder and machinegun fire , but the line had to be cleared by an infantry assault later in the day . The tanks were ordered to outflank the defences and advance further into the island , and they were soon joined by two otherdispatched from the beaches ; the small force continued to advance until it encountered theFrench main line of defence . This had been built prior to the First World War and included camouflaged, machinegun nests and dugin 75 mm artillery pieces ; the latter , although not specifically designed for an antitank role , could penetrate the armour of both theand the. The twoadvanced first but were knocked out by artillery fire , and twothat were moving behind them suffered the same fate ; the thirdretreated in order to report on the French resistance , machinea motorcycle combination and a truck it encountered on the way back .The commander of themade his report , and was then ordered to take command of fourand twowhich had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the French defences . The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to outflank the line by advancing from the righthand side , using several hills as cover ; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one Valentine and onewere hit and destroyed . The remaining tanks exchanged severalof fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions . The French line was eventually broken by 29th Brigade , aided by an amphibious assault by Royal Marines ; the remaining tanks of ' B ' Squadron , twoand three, remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May , coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another Valentine . The squadron played no further part in the battle , as theFrench authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day , although French troops would continue to engage the British occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late November . ' C ' Squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion ; only one Valentine and threeout of twelve tanks were functional by 7 May , and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded . It remained in Madagascar until early 1943 , when it was shipped to India and took part in the Burma Campaign as part of 29th Brigade .Because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid1940 , when the British airborne establishment was formed , the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops . Progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation , Operation, was conducted by aCommando unit . By 1942 , there existed specifically trained airborne units , including the 1st Airborne Division , and on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division . This unit , designated the Light Tank Squadron , was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division , using their tanks ' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units . The obvious unit for conversion was ' C ' Special Services Squadron , as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and , more importantly , was the only unit that was still using; it had been redesignated as an airborne tank by the War Office . ' C ' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942 , bringing with it sevenamong its other vehicles . The unit immediately began training , but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long ; during mid1943 , the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily . ' C ' Squadron remained in Britain , as not enoughgliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its; the squadron was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division , which had been raised in April 1943 , and ' C ' Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict . The squadron continued to train as an airportable unit , and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties , including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counterattacking enemy infantry and armour .On 13 December 1943 , the War Office decided to expand the squadron into a regiment equipped with a combination of light tanks and conventional reconnaissance vehicles such as scout cars , and on 1 April 1944 , it was redesignated as the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment . The regiment consisted of a Headquarters Squadron , a Light Tank Squadron and a Reconnaissance Squadron ; two, the Mark 1variation , were attached to the Headquarters Squadron , but the Light Tank Squadron , also known as ' A ' Squadron , received the majority of the. ' A ' Squadron had approximately nineteensplit between six troops , two of which were of thevariation and the rest were armed with 2 pounders fitted with . On 24 May 1944 , after participating in a further series of exercises and manoeuvres , ' A ' Squadron moved from their training area to a transit camp at airfield , while the rest of the regiment moved to RAFNorton airfield the next day ; from these two airfields , the regiment would be transported from to participate in the British airborne landings in Normandy . The operation began on the night of 5 June , with the deployment of 6th Airborne Division to eastern Normandy . It was tasked with protecting the eastern flank of the Alliedlandings , securing strategically important areas east of Caen , capturing several important bridges over the Caen Canal and River, and destroying a coastal artillery battery .transport aircraft were available to land all three of the division 's brigades simultaneously ; one would have to be landed in a second lift later in the day . Major General Richard Gale had initially intended for the 6thBrigade , to which the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment was attached , to be landed first ; however , aerial photography revealed that antiglider poles had been erected in the landing zone selected for the brigade . Therefore , Gale decided that the 3rd Parachute Brigade and 5th Parachute Brigade  should land in the first lift to clear the landing zones , allowing the 6thBrigade to land in the second lift .Theandgliders of the brigade landed at 21 : 00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of obstructions by the 5th Parachute Brigade . The primary tasks of the brigade were to bring in reinforcements and supplies , and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division ; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was to aid in the latter task , acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counterattack . Theof ' A ' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed , but the squadron 's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy . It lost one tank before the formation landed when thebroke loose of itsand crashed through the nose of the glider that was carrying it , causing both to fall into the sea midflight . The squadron 's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone , destroying themselves and thethey carried ; a thirdhit anotheras it was beingand flipped the tank upside down , rendering it unusable , although the crew escaped without injury . The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding.The squadron retrieved all of the remainingand advanced to the south of the landing zone to link up with the rest of the regiment ; there , they received orders to support the 8th Parachute Battalion in thedearea and conduct reconnaissance duties . After linking with the battalion , the squadron began, and engaged German infantry and armour they encountered . By the end of 7 June , twohad been lost to enemy action , one destroyed by a German selfpropelled gun and the second by hitting a mine . The division was reinforced by British troops who were advancing from the invasion beaches and it began to push through Normandy , while the squadron continued its reconnaissance duties . At this time , Gale decided to avoid , when possible , engaging thewith German armour , as they proved to be completelyby the German tanks and selfpropelled guns , such as the Panzer IV and theIII . Instead , when the division required armoured support , it summoned it from armoured units outside the division , and thewere used to support infantry patrols and provide fire support . By August , in the division 's preparation for the planned breakout from the Normandy bridgehead , the majority ofin ' A ' Squadron were replaced with Cromwell fast cruiser tanks ; only threeremained , assigned to the Headquarters troop of ' A ' Squadron .Operation Tonga was the last thatsaw of active combat . During the first week of October 1944 , the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment underwent an extensive, in which it was completely, and all the remainingwere retired . They were replaced with the , a purposebuilt airborne light tank of American design ; eightwere used by the regiment in March 1945 during Operation, the airborne operation to cross the river Rhine . A report issued by the Director  of the War Office in January 1946 confirmed that thedesign was considered obsolete , and any light tanks used in postwar airborne formations would be entirely new in design . A small number ofremained in service with the 3rd Hussars until 1949 ; aglider flight was stationed at RAF, and a troop ofwas kept by the regiment for training exercises with the gliders . However , glider training by the regiment was stopped in 1950 and thewithdrawn from service .There were several variants of thedesign . The first was the Light Tank Mk VIII , VickersArmstrong 's proposed successor to the. The Mark VIII was also known as the Harry Hopkins , named after President Roosevelt 's chief diplomatic advisor , and was given the General Staff design numberby the War Office . The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of thein a number of areas . It had thicker armour than the, with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of 38 millimetres  and the side armour to 17 millimetres  , and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces to helpshells fired at the tank . The dimensions of thewere also changed ; the Mark VIII was longer by 6 inches  , wider by 1 foot 3 inches  and heavier . The new tank was no longer airportable , as it was too heavy to be carried by a. The 12cylinder engine of thewas fitted to the Mark VIII , although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to 30 miles per hour  ; its armament also remained the same as that of the. The War Office authorised the construction of three prototype models in April 1941 . The new design was considered a success , and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1000 to be constructed in September . However , problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes , and a report issued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems . These problems continued to persist into 1943 , when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service ; approximately 100 Markwere produced by 1945 , when production ended .A second variant on thedesign was the Drive  . TheDrive system was invented by Nicholas, and was designed to allow a tank to ' swim ' through water and participate in amphibious operations . The system functioned bya largecanvas screen around the tank above its tracks , which was supported by thirtysixtubes and steel struts ; this gave the tank sufficientto float , and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank 's engine . The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land . The system was fitted during June 1941 , as thewas the lightest light tank available at the time ; the converted tank was successfully tested on a number of lakes and reservoirs , allowing theDrive system to be tested on heavier tanks , such as the Valentine . The system would be used during Operation, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches ., known in Japan as I Love Donald Duck : Georgiano , is a 1991video game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis . The game was released in Europe in 1991 , in North America on December 19 , 1991 and in Japan on December 20 , 1991 .stars Donald Duck and his three nephews , Huey ,, and, as treasurehunters , and is part of a series of games published by Sega that were based on Walt Disney cartoon characters . was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists . The game was universally lauded for its graphics , with magazines like Sega Pro describing them as " some of the best graphics around . " The game was also praised for its music and puzzles , as well as their clever use in the game . However ,was criticized for its controls , being described by IGN as " floaty " and making certain segments of the gamedifficult . The game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples , which several other Genesis games of the time had .The player , as Donald , ventures through a variety of sidescrolling levels . Generally , each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon , such as the's palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides . Although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections , various obstacles prevent the player from entering theoutside of a specific order . In addition to this , some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections . Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area , he may leave by calling his nephews ' biplane , and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return .Donald is armed with a special gun that can shoot, popcorn or bubble gum . Donald has unlimitedwhich can only temporarilyenemies  , and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from . Later in the game , theis upgraded to act as a temporary platform to climb walls with and , when stuck to a passing bird , allows Donald to traverse longer distances . In, India and Egypt , Donald can also pick up which increase his temper , eventually temporarily allowing him to become, increase his speed and knock out enemies in his path .While Donald isthrough some books in 's library , a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of King, ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom in ancient times . The map leads to the location of the king 's most prized possession , hidden in a secret place shortly before his death . Donald thinks this is his path to riches . Unfortunately Big Bad Peteand pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure . with his nephews Huey ,, and, and using the partial map from the library , Donald begins his search in, with the trail being directed to an Aztec pyramid in Mexico . Outside the pyramid , he is directed by a " sweet" to obtain a " hero key " from an explorer back into open the pyramid . Inside the pyramid , Donald meets, who gives him a strange note and ato help him reach higher places , and tells him that is looking for him back in. Travelling across theofto meet, Donald is given's latest invention , that can break through walls . The last location on the partial map is Count's castle in Transylvania , where Donald encounters a ghost who tells him that the Count carries the real treasure map .After defeating, Donald receives a more complete map . In India , Donald enters the palace of the, where she challenges him to defeat the tiger in her garden in exchange for a . Donald succeeds and receives the , which is the key to open a temple in Egypt . Donald is able to solve the "of the" using the notehad given him , and obtains theof Ra before escaping in a mine cart . From there , he journeys to the South Pole , where he finds a key frozen in ice , and uses theof Ra to melt the ice and grab the key . The key unlocks the hold of a Viking ship , which contains an ancient diary with the secret to locating the treasure . The ship is haunted by ghosts , and the Viking captain sends Donald below decks to get rid of them . After defeating a skeletal Viking warrior , Donald returns to the deck , where the captain informs him that the diary is hidden in ice near the South Pole , and gives him an " ancient Viking" thatto flying creatures . Donald then returns to the South Pole ,a ride on one of Pete 's birdto reach the diary .However , upon finding the diary , Pete shows up , holding Donald 's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary . After giving Pete the diary , Donald travels to Pete 's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back . The diary reveals that the map , when dipped in water , will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure . Donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault . After defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure , Donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue . When the disappointed Donald returns home , Huey ,andaccidentally break the statue , which reveals a goldennecklace was hidden inside . Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together . was developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis as part of a series of games that were based on Walt Disney cartoon characters . The game was released in Europe in 1991 , in North America on December 19 , 1991 and in Japan on December 20 , 1991 .was later released as part of a bundle called The Disney Collection for Genesis in 1996 alongside Castle of Illusion . The game was also ported to the Sega Saturn and released exclusively in Japan alongside Castle of Illusion again as part of the Sega Ages series in 1998 , entitled Sega Ages : I Love Mickey Mouse . received a mostly positive response from critics upon release . GameRankings , an aggregator for video game reviews , assigned the game a score of 77 % based on 2 reviews . Mega placed the game at # 7 in their " Top Mega Drive Games of All Time " list .magazine praised the game 's graphics , but criticized the game 's easy difficulty level , explaining simply that " the graphics are excellent , but the game is easy to complete . " Damianfrom Sega Pro also praised the graphics , stating that the game has " without [ a ] doubt some of the best graphics around " and that " the sprites and backgrounds are consistently excellent . " He also noted the game 's various puzzles and their use in the game , explaining that " [ e ]if the ideas are not original , the way they are strung together to accelerate the pace tois nothing short of breathtaking . " Levi Buchanan from IGN gavea 73 / 10 , also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing . criticized Donald 's controls in certain situations in the game , as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles . Buchanan also criticized the controls , calling them " floaty " and noted the difficulty in executing precision jumps , explaining that " [ i ] t 's far too easy toor undershoot a narrow column and slip to your. "was also " dubious of the number of credits , " stating that the game may seem easy with unlimited continues , but that the player will " still need considerable skill to reach the treasure island . " Buchanan was disappointed with the lack of speech samples , explaining that it 's " a bit of a drag with a character that is so defined by his voice . " Ultimately ,said that " [ y ]players will instantly beby Donald 's quest " and that "is everything a cartoon game should be and more . " Buchanan summed up the game as being a " good platformerup by some questionable controls " and recommended the game as " aenjoyable 16bit platformer that would fit nicely in your Genesis collection . " Thecolossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of thecivilization of ancient. All portray mature men with , flat, and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants ofand Veracruz . The backs of the monuments often are flat . The boulders were brought from the Sierra de losmountains of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances , requiring a great deal of human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individualrulers . Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress . The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at majorcentres , but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear .The discovery of a colossal head at in the nineteenth century spurred the first archaeological investigations ofculture by Matthewin 1938 . Seventeen confirmed examples are known from four sites within the on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Most colossal heads were sculpted from spherical boulders but two from San Lorenzowere recarved from massive stone. An additional monument , at in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example from outside the . the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation . Most have been dated to the Earlyperiod  with some to the Middle period . The smallest weigh 6 tons , while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons , although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone .Thecivilization developed in the lowlands of southeastern Mexico between 1500 and 400 BC . The lies on the Gulf Coast of Mexico within the states of Veracruz and, an area measuring approximately 275 kilometres  east to west and extending about 100 kilometres  inland from the coast . Theare regarded as the first civilization to develop inand the is one of sixof civilization worldwide , the others being the culture of South America , theculture of China 's Yellow River , the Indus Valley Civilization of south Asia , the civilization of ancient Egypt and thecivilization of ancient Iraq . Of these , only thecivilization developed in a lowland tropical forest setting .Thewere the first inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities . They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture . In the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged ofwriting , with the earliest examples ofhieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC . Examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts ; the texts are short and have been partiallybased on their similarity to otherscripts . The evidence of complex society developing in the has led to thebeing regarded as the " Mother Culture " of, although this concept remains controversial .Some of the' rulers seem to have served religious functions . The city of San Lorenzo was succeeded as the main centre of the civilization by Lain about 900 BC , with andde lospossibly sharing the role ; other urban centres were much less significant . The nature and degree of the control exercised by the centres over a widespread rural population remains unclear . Very fineart , much clearly made for an elite , survives in several forms , notablyfigurines , and larger sculptures such as The. The figurines have been recovered in large numbers and are mostly in pottery ; these were presumably widely available to the population . Together with these , of particular relevance to the colossal heads are the " style masks " in stone , so called because none have yet been excavated in circumstances that allow the proper archaeological identification of ancontext . These evocative stone face masks present both similarities and differences to the colossal heads . Two thirds ofmonumental sculpture represents the human form , and the colossal heads fall within this major theme ofart .The colossal heads cannot be precisely dated . However , the San Lorenzo heads were buried by 900 BC , indicating that their period of manufacture and use was earlier still . The heads from had been moved from their original context before they were investigated by archaeologists and the heads from Lawere found partially exposed on the modern ground surface . The period of production of the colossal heads is therefore unknown , as is whether it spanned a century or a millennium . Estimates of the time span during which colossal heads were produced vary from 50 to 200 years . The San Lorenzo heads are believed to be the oldest , and are the mostexecuted . All of the stone heads have been assigned to theperiod ofchronology , generally to the Early , although the two heads and the LaHead are attributed to the Middle . colossal heads vary in height from 147 to 34 metres  and weigh between 6 and 50 tons . All of thecolossal heads depict mature men with flatand ; the eyes tend to be slightly crossed . The general physical characteristics of the heads are of a type that is still common among people in theregion in modern times . The backs of the heads are often flat , as if the monuments were originally placed against a wall . All examples ofcolossal heads wear distinctivethat probably represent cloth or animal hide originals . Some examples have a tied knot at the back of the head , and some are decorated with feathers . A head from Lais decorated with the head of a bird . There are similarities between theon some of the heads that has led to speculation that specificmay represent different dynasties , or perhaps identify specific rulers . Most of the heads wear largeinserted into the ear lobes .All of the heads are realistic ,anddescriptions of the men . It is likely that they were portraits of living  rulers well known to the. Each head is distinct and, displayingfeatures . They were once thought to representalthough this theory is no longer widely held ; it is possible , however , that they represent rulers equipped for the .expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling . The most art is the earliest , appearing suddenly without surviving, with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed . Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from Eldemonstrate that theare likely to have created many moresculptures than works sculpted from stone .In the late nineteenth century , Joséy Serrano described a colossal head as having " Ethiopian " features and speculations that thehad African origins resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso and in the 1970s in the writings of Ivan van. Such speculation is not taken seriously byscholars such as Richardand Ann.Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar , there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution . One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint , suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated . Heads did not just represent individualrulers ; they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself .The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned , given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more powerfulrulers were able tosuch resources . The workforce would have included, labourers ,,,and otherproducing the tools to make and move the monument , in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers . The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end .Archaeological investigation ofbasalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and smallof stone . The sculpture was then refined bythe surface using, which were generally roundedthat could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case .were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail .colossal heads were fashioned as intheround monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on theand. Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of recarving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed .All seventeen of the confirmed heads in the were sculpted from basalt mined in the Sierra de losmountains of Veracruz . Most were formed from coarsedark grey basalt known as basalt after a volcano in the range .have proposed that large basalt boulders found on the southeastern slopes of the mountains are the source of the stone for the monuments . These boulders are found in an area affected by large that carried substantial blocks of stone down the mountain slopes , which suggests that thedid not need to quarry the raw material forthe heads . Roughly spherical boulders were carefully selected to mimic the shape of a human head . The stone for the San Lorenzo and Laheads was transported a considerable distance from the source . The Lahead was found on Elhill in the Sierra de losand the stone fromHead 1 and Head 1  came from the same hill .The boulders were transported over 150 kilometres  from the source of the stone . The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown , especially since thelackedof burden and functional wheels , and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible . Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made thetransport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical . Two badly damagedsculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes . A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . These sculptures may well depictrulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments . When transport over land was necessary , theare likely to have used, ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads . The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains ; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country . The construction of temporaryusing the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau . Earth structures such as mounds , platforms andupon the plateau demonstrate that thepossessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build largescale earthworks .The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumentalfrom which they were reworked . Only four of the seventeenheads do not have flattened backs , indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments . Alternatively , the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport , providing a stable form forthe monuments with ropes . Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments .Seventeen confirmed examples are known . An additional monument , at in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example outside of the on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Possible fragments of additional colossal heads have been recovered at San Lorenzo and at San Fernando in.colossal stone heads are also known in the Southern Maya area where they are associated with thestyle of sculpture . Although some arguments have been made that they are pre , these latter monuments are generally believed to be influenced by thestyle of sculpture .The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running northsouth across the site . Although some were recovered from, they were found close to their originaland had been buried by local erosion . These heads , together with a number of monumental stone, probably formed a processional route across the site , powerfully displaying its dynastic history . Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been recarved from older.San LorenzoHead 1  was lying facing upwards when excavated . The erosion of a path passing on top of the monument uncovered its eye and led to the discovery of thesite .Head 1 is 284 metres  high ; it measures 211 metres  wide and it weighs 253 tons . The monument was discovered partially buried at the edge of a gully by Matthewin 1945 . When discovered it was lying on its back , looking upwards . It was associated with a large number of broken ceramic vessels and figurines . The majority of these ceramic remains have been dated to between 800 and 400 BC ; some pieces have been dated to the Villa Alta phase  . The headdress possesses a plain band that is tied at the back of the head . The upper portion of the headdress is decorated with a Ushaped motif . This element descends across the front of the headdress , terminating on the forehead . On the front portion it is decorated with five semicircular motifs . Thepiece does not meet the horizontal band , leaving a space between the two pieces . On each side of the face a strap descends from the headdress and passes in front of the ear . The forehead is wrinkled in a. The lips are slightly parted without revealing the teeth . Theare pronounced and the ears are particularly well executed . The face is slightly asymmetric , which may be due to error on the part of theor may accurately reflect the physical features of the portrait 's subject . The head has been moved to thedede .San LorenzoHead 2  was reworked from a monumental throne . The head stands 269 metres  high and measures 183 metres  wide by 105 metres  deep ; it weighs 20 tons .Head 2 was discovered in 1945 when Matthew's guide cleared away some of the vegetation and mud that covered it . The monument was found lying on its back , facing the sky , and was excavated in 1946 byand Philip. In 1962 the monument was removed from the San Lorenzo plateau in order to put it on display as part of " Thetradition " exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston in 1963 . San LorenzoHead 2 is currently in the dein Mexico City . The head was associated with a number of ceramic finds ; they have been dated to the Earlyand Late Classic periods .Head 2 wears a complex headdress that sports a horizontal band tied at the back of the head ; this is decorated with three bird 's heads that are located above the forehead and temples . Thepiece is formed from six strips running towards the back of the head . The front of the headdress above the horizontal band is plain . Two shorthang down from the headdress in front of the ears . The ear jewellery is formed by large or framed discs . The left and right ornaments are different , with radial lines on the left, a feature absent on the right. The head is badly damaged due to an unfinished reworking process . This process hasthe entire face with at least 60 smallerand 2 larger holes . The surviving features appear to depict an ageing man with the foreheadinto a. The lips are thick and slightly parted to reveal the teeth ; the head has a pronounced chin .San LorenzoHead 3 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 3 . The head measures 178 metres  high by 163 metres  wide by 095 metres  deep and weighs 94 tons . The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthewin 1946 ; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully . The monument was found 08 kilometres  southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo , however , its original location is unknown ; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture . Head 3 has been moved to thedede. The headdress is complex , with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal, with diagonal folds above each eye . A smalltops the headdress . A large flap formed of fourdrops down both sides of the head , completely covering the ears . The face has a typicallybrow and , unusually , has clearly defined eyelids . The lips are thick and slightly parted ; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely , and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions .San LorenzoHead 4  weighs 6 tons and has been moved to thedede.Head 4 is 178 metres  high , 117 metres  wide and 095 metres  deep . The head was discovered by Matthewin 1946 , 550 metres  northwest of the principal mound , at the edge of a gully . When excavated , it was found to be lying on its righthand side and in a very good state of preservation .materials excavated with the head became mixed with ceramics associated with Head 5 , making ceramic dating of the monument difficult . The headdress is decorated with a horizontal band formed of four sculpted, similar to those of Head 3 . On the righthand side , threedescend from the upper portion of the headdress ; they terminate in a total of eight strips that hang down across the horizontal band . Theseare judged to represent hair rather than. Also on the right hand side , twodescend across the ear and continue to the base of the monument . On the lefthand side , three verticaldescend across the ear . Theis only visible on the right hand side ; it is formed of a plain disc and. The face is that of an ageing man with aforehead , lowand a prominent chin . The lips are thick and slightly parted .San LorenzoHead 5 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 5 . The monument stands 186 metres  high and measures 147 metres  wide by 115 metres  deep . It weighs 116 tons . The head was discovered by Matthewin 1946 , face down in a gully to the south of the principal mound . The head is particularly well executed and is likely to have been found close to its original location .recovered during its excavation became mixed with those from the excavation of Head 4 . The mixed ceramics have been dated to the San Lorenzo and Villa Alta phases  .Head 5 is particularly well preserved , although the back of the headdress band was damaged when the head was moved from the archaeological site . The band of the headdress is set at an angle and has a notch above the bridge of the nose . The headdress is decorated with jaguar paws ; this general identification of the decoration is contested byde lasince the " paws " have three claws each ; she identifies them as the claws of a bird of prey . At the back of the head , tenstrips form a net decorated with disc motifs . Two shortdescend from the headdress in front of the ears . The ears are adorned with discshapedwith. The face is that of an ageing man withunder the eyes and across the bridge of the nose , and a forehead that isin a. The lips are slightly parted .Head 5 has been moved to thedede.San LorenzoHead 6  is one of the smaller examples of colossal heads , standing 167 metres  . It measures 141 metres  wide by 126 metres  deep and is estimated to weigh between 8 and 10 tons . The head was discovered by a localand was excavated in 1965 by Luisand Chan . The head had collapsed into a ravine under its own weight and was found face down on its left hand side . In 1970 it was transported to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for the museum 's centenary exhibition . After its return to Mexico , it was placed in the dein Mexico City . It is sculpted with a netlike head covering joined together with sculpted beads . A covering descends from under the headdress to cover the back half of the neck . Theis divided into four strips and begins above the right ear , extending around the entire head . A short strap descends from either side of the head to the ear . The ear ornaments are complex and are larger at the front of the ear than at the back . The face is that of an ageing male with the foreheadin a,under the eyes , and deepon either side of the nose . The face is somewhat asymmetric , possibly due to errors in the execution of the monument .San LorenzoHead 7  measures 27 metres  high by 185 metres  wide by 135 metres  deep and weighs 18 tons . San LorenzoHead 7 was reworked from a monumental throne ; it was discovered by a joint archaeological project by the dee Historia and Yale University , as a result of asurvey . It was buried at a depth of less than 1 metre  and was lying facing upwards , leaning slightly northwards on its right hand side . The head is poorly preserved and has suffered both from erosion and deliberate damage . The headdress is decorated with a pair of human hands ; a feathered ornament is carved at the back of theand two discs adorn the front . A short strap descends from theand hangs in front of the right ear . The head sports largethat completely cover the, although severe erosion makes their exact form difficult to distinguish . The face hasbetween the nose and, and deepset eyes ; the lips are badly damaged and the mouth is open , displaying the teeth . In 1986 the head was transported to thedede.San LorenzoHead 8  stands 22 metres  high ; it measures 165 metres  wide by 16 metres  deep and weighs 13 tons . It is one of the finest examples of ancolossal head . It was found lying on its side to the south of a monumental throne . The monument was discovered at a depth of 5 metres  during asurvey of the site in 1968 ; it has been dated to the Early. After discovery it was initially reburied ; it was moved to thededein 1986 . The headdress is decorated with theor claws of either a jaguar or an eagle . It has aand a cover that descends from under the headdress proper behind the ears . Two shortdescend in front of the ears . The head sports large ear ornaments in the form of. The face is that of a mature male with andbetween these and the nose . The forehead is gathered in a. The mouth is slightly parted to reveal the teeth . Most of the head is carved in a realistic manner , the exception being the ears . These are stylised and represented by one question mark shape contained within another . The head is very well preserved and displays a fine finish .San LorenzoHead 9 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 66 . It measures 165 metres  high by 136 metres  wide by 117 metres  deep . The head was exposed in 1982 by erosion of theat San Lorenzo ; it was found leaning slightly on its right hand side and facing upwards , half covered by the collapsed side of a gully and washed by a stream .

These heads are sculpted with relatively simple; they have squat , wide proportions and distinctive facial features . The two heads are the earliest known stone monuments from the site . The discovery of one of the heads in the nineteenth century led to the first archaeological investigations ofculture , carried out by Matthewin 1938 .Monument A  was the first colossal head to be found , discovered by accident in the middle of the nineteenth century , 1 kilometre  to the north of the modern village of .

Butler became the first team since the shot clock was adopted for the 1985 – 86 season to hold five straight tournament opponents under 60 points .On April 5 , 2010 , Butler and Duke faced off in what The New York Times called " the most eagerly awaited championship game in years " . Late in the first half , Duke went on an 8 – 0 run to take a 26 – 20 lead . Stevens called a timeout . With starters Matt Howard and Ronaldon the bench in foul trouble , Stevens was forced to call on backup center Averywho came up big for Butler .scored 10 first half points , tying his season high . At half time , Duke 's lead stood at 33 – 32 .The second half was played very closely , with neither team taking a substantial lead . With 3 : 16 to play , Duke took a 60 – 55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith . Butler cut the lead to one point in the final minute and , after a missed Kylejump shot with 36 seconds remaining , got a chance to retake the lead . Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play . A failedattempt and a timeout later ,missed a baseline fadeawayand Briancame down with the rebound for Duke . He was quickly fouled with less than 4 seconds remaining .narrowly missed ahalfcourt shot court as time expired , making the final margin 61 – 59 .The loss snapped Butler 's 25game winning streak , the longest in school history . Butler became the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970 . Stevens became the secondyoungest head coach to coach in the NCAA National Championship Game , behind Branchwho led the Indianato the 1940 National Championship at age 31 . Stevens was named as both a Hugh Durham and JimAwardfor the third consecutive year , losing to Mike Young and Jamie Dixon respectively . He was also afor theProsser Man of the Year Award , which was won by Bob.Butler finished the year ranked # 2 in the Coaches ' Poll , the highest ranking in school history . The school was ranked for 19 consecutive weeks , tying the school record .After the end of the 2009 – 10 season , Brad Stevens and Butler continued to attract considerable attention . President Barack Obama personally called Stevens tohim on Butler 's season . David Letterman had Stevens on his show for a guest appearance . Butler admissions inquiries shot up 67 % . Stevens received fan letters from around the world , and his phone rang off the hook . He was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10 . " It 's all been very surreal , " Stevens said . " If you are the runnerup , you don 't expect to talk to the president . " " It 's been a little overwhelming , because I 'm a pretty simple guy , " he added .The 2009 – 10 season also helped increase Butler 's recruiting profile . Asked if the increased fame would change things , Stevens said it better nothim or the university . " I look at this new challenge of not changing and sticking to your core values and making sure you remain humble as a great coaching opportunity . "Rankings by ESPN 's Andy Katz and Fox Sports ' Jeff Goodman released shortly after the 2010 Championship game both had Butler third for the 2010 – 2011 season . Duke coach Mikeagreed , saying Butler would be " right up there , No. 1 or No. 2 ... They 'll be a favorite next year . " However ,chose to leave early for the NBA Draft and Butler went through a rough patch early in the season , at one point losing three straight games and having a 6 – 5 conference record .by the emergence of Andrew Smith at center and Matt Howard 's success as a perimeter forward , Butler ended up winning a share of the conference title at 13 – 5 . The Bulldogs then won the Horizon League Tournament to secure an automatic NCAA tournament bid , and received an 8 seed . by many to lose a firstround matchup against Old Dominion , Butler advanced on a lastsecond tipin by Howard . Howard was also clutch in their next game , hitting a free throw with a less than one second remaining to beat Pitt in a dramatic finish .Mack scored 30 points in the win . Butler won their next game when they defeated Wisconsin . On March 26 , 2011 , the Bulldogs beat Florida 74 – 71 in overtime to earn backtoback trips to the Final Four . On April 2 , Butler beat fellow Cinderella team70 – 62 to make it to a second consecutive national championship game . For the second consecutive year , the Bulldogs fell in the national championship game , this time to Connecticut .On April 8 , 2010 , Stevens signed a longterm deal with Butler , extending his contract through the– 22 season . Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed ; however , Butler president Bobbyhad publicly stated that the university could afford to increase Stevens ' base salary to approximately US $ 1000000 a few days prior . Stevens had previously made US $ 395000 plus benefits in base salary , a relatively low figure for a successful Division I head basketball coach . His total compensation for 2009 – 10 was estimated at US $ 750000 . Stevens had received a raise after each of his three seasons at Butler and his contract contains a buyout clause estimated in the high six or low seven figures .By resigning with Butler , Stevens temporarily ended speculation that he would leave the university for a higher paying job . Oregon , Clemson , and Wake Forest were all said to be interested in offering Stevens multimillion dollar contracts to leave Butler . " First and foremost , I ’ m loyal to Butler , " Stevens said . When asked if he would ever leave Butler , Stevens replied " I guess if they kicked me out . "After the 2011 – 12 season , Stevens was pursued vigorously by Illinois to fill their coaching vacancy before he declined their offer .In March 2013 , UCLA reportedly offered Stevens between $ 25 and $ 3 million a year to leave Butler .circulated that Stevens was in contract negotiations with UCLA , but ultimately the rumors proved false and Stevens stayed at Butler . Commenting on the situation , a source close to Stevens said " Brad doesn 't understand why people would assume he 's leaving . " A few days later , Stevens reiterated that he was very happy at Butler and had no intentions to leave as long as he had the support of the university to continue running the program the " right way " .On July 3 , 2013 , Stevens was signed as the head coach by the Boston Celtics . Reports state that his new contract is a sixyear , $ 22 million deal . In April 2015 , Stevens led the Celtics to the NBAas the 7th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 40 – 42 record . On April 21 , 2015 , it was announced that Stevens finished fourth in voting for the NBA 's Coach of the Year Award . On March 1 , 2016 , Stevens was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for games played during February . In April 2016 , Brad Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance under his tenure as the 5th seed in the 2016 NBAfinishing the season with a 48 – 34 record . On June 1 , 2016 , Stevens received a contract extension .According to Stevens , in one of his first games as head coach , he was nervous and " felt like our team played on edge " because of it . He decided that a team 's play will reflect the mood of its coach ; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations , while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge . " I don ’ t want to lose a game because of my approach , " he told himself . Accordingly , he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games . He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional , instead quietly observing on thewith folded arms . He does not get upset about bad calls byor player mistakes , preferring to focus on " the next play " rather than what just happened . Butler player Willieexplained Butler 's 2010 Final Four run by saying , " When those big runs [ by Syracuse and Kansas State ] came , Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words . Then he said he believes in us , he loves us and we 're going to win the game . " On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player , he does it with " positive reinforcement , just at a little louder" , according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves . Above all , Stevens wants his players to be confident , not living in fear of beingfor making a bad play . , Stevens is always calm , but internally he is far from it . " I 'm not as calm as everybody thinks , " Stevens says . His wife Tracy adds , " He ’ s calm and collected , but he ’ s fiercely competitive . He ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you . " Former player Joelsays " Everyone sees Brad as a levelheaded , calm and cool coach , but he ’ s about as competitive of a guy as I know . We would get into it constantly , whether playing twoontwo or arguing about players ’ having better college careers . "Stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game , and always tries to add a few newspecific to that game 's opponent . Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert " on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents ' weaknesses . " Former player Ronaldagrees : " We know everything we need to about our opponents , all their tendencies are broken down " ahead of time .Stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions , spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film . " I think it 's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players " , he explains . For example , when Butler wasin late 2010 , Stevens challenged his team : " this [ 46 % defensive field goal percentage ] is where we are . This isn 't acceptable to get to where we want to go . But what does that really mean ? It 's not just get better, it is , if we give up 3 lessa game , then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country " . The team got the message , improved throughout the season , and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense . In 2012 , Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff . If he had the resources , Stevens says he would hire a team ofto analyze the teams play .Stevens ' teams are built around solid basketballand good team work , rather than individual basketball skill . His teams are known for their defense , forcing opponents intomistakes . The secret to basketball – and life – is " just to do the job to the best of your ability and don 't worry about anything else , " Stevens says . "the next game .the next possession . That 's our focus . It 's boring . It 's also the way championships are won " , he says . In short , Stevens is a strong believer in " The Butler Way " – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team . " I tell the players ' the Butler Way ' isn 't easy to define , " Stevens says , " but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball , play with great energy and defend . "Stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after " top recruits . " " The guys we [ have ] recruited , most of them weren 't very highly ranked , " Stevens says . " They had very good high school careers or careers at other places  , but for one reason or the other they weren 't seen as great players . But they all had. " Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a " one and done " player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally .Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching, but is not interested in selfpromotion . He instead prefers tothe praise he receives to the players , athletic department , and his. He has not been known to posture for more money , or to leak his name for open coaching positions . He has been described as humble , modest , and not " about the money " .The New York Times , USA Today , ESPN , and other commentators have attributed Butler 's success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens ' coaching style . The Times remarks , " the Bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents , and they do noteasily " , and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team 's success . " He coaches to his personality and to his strengths , "says . ", he has greatand communication ability with his team . " Yahoo ! Sports compared Stevens to legendary coach John Wooden writing " Brad Stevens is winning at Butler the Wooden way – calm and composed on the. " Wooden agreed , saying , " I enjoy watching [ Stevens ] and very much enjoy [ Butler 's ] style of play . "Brad Stevens is known for his youthful looks , often being described as " babyfaced " . One commentator remarked , " Stevens looks like he checks the mirror every morning to see if it 's time to start. " On occasion , he has been mistaken for a player . He is also known for projecting a professional , " corporate " look from the sidelines . Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching , he replies " If everything else remained the same , I would have been as happy as... Friends and family and faith , they 're going to take the cake over all this stuff . " Stevens met his wife , Tracy  , while attendingUniversity . Tracy , who played soccer for, quickly learned of Brad 's love for basketball ; on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game . Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995 , and fromin 1999 . She returned to school in 2000 , driving five hours from Case Western 's law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Brad . She finished her final year of law school in Indianapolis , and the couple married in August 2003 . Tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer . Tracy also serves as Brad 's agent .Brad and Tracy Stevens are involved with the American Cancer Society 's Coaches. Cancer . Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy 's mother died of the disease in June 2004 . The day before Butler 's 2010 Final Four appearance , they hosted a fundraiser for the organization . Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to theFoundation for Kids , a charity children run by former Butler player Avery. Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family ; he notably took a onegame leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith , a player on both of Butler 's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer ; Smith died less than a week later . At the request of Andrew 's widow , Sam , Brad delivered theat the memorial service on January 17 , 2016 .Stevens ' father , Mark , is ansurgeon in Indianapolis and former Indianafootball player .

The peaks along the crater 's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight , while the interior isin shadow  . The lowtemperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freezeshed during comet impacts on the Moon . Measurements by the spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater , which may indicate the presence of water ice . The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest.The rotational axis of the Moon lies within, only a few kilometers from its center . The crater is 21 km in diameter and 42 km deep . From the Earth , it is viewed edgeon in a region of rough ,terrain . It is located within the South Pole basin on a. The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted . No significant craters intersect the rim , and it is sloped about 15 ° toward the direction 50 – 90 ° from the Earth . The age of the crater is about 36 billion years and it has been in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years .Because the orbit of the Moon isonly 5 ° from the ecliptic , the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness . Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earthbased radar studies .along the rim of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight , spending about 80 – 90 % of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun .illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s .The shadowed portion of the crater waswith theCamera of the Japanesespacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim . The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30 ° slope that leads down to a 66 km diameter floor . The handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters . The bottom is covered by an uneven moundlike feature that is 300 to 400 m thick . The central peak is about 200 m in height .The continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100 K. For, the average temperature was determined to be about 90 K , reaching 88 K at the crater floor . Under these conditions , the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m / s . Any water vapor that arrives here following aimpact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface . However , the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar farside , suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice .This crater was named after Ernest Henry, an AngloIrish explorer of Antarctica from 1901 until his death in 1922 . The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994 . Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker ,, de,, and.farther away , on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side , are the larger cratersand Scott , named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent .From the perspective of the Earth , this crater lies along the southern limb of the Moon , making observation difficult . Detailed mapping of the polar regions andof the Moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft .lies entirely within the rim of the immense South Pole basin , which is one of the largest known impact formations in the Solar System . This basin is over 12 kilometers deep , and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior .A neutronon board the spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles , including the crater. At the end of this mission in July 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earthbased telescopes an impactgenerated plume containing water vapor . The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . Alternatively , it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into theto liberate significant quantities of water vapor .From Earthbased radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge ,appears to be relatively intact ; much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts . This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep , which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle . In addition , it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity ofsince its formation . However other craters in the vicinity are considerably older , and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen , possibly in the form of water ice .  , for example . )Radar studies preceding and following the mission demonstrate that the inner walls ofare similar in reflective characteristics to those of somecraters . In particular , the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in itsblanket , suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface, and not ice deposits , as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving themission . This interpretation , however , is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community . Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13 cm show no evidence for water ice deposits .Optical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the Japanese lunarspacecraftin 2007 . It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice , down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel .On November 15 , 2008 , a 34kg probe made a hard landing near the crater . The moon impact probe  was launched from the Indian I spacecraft and reached the surface 25 minutes later . The probe carried a radar, video imaging system , and a mass, which will be used to search for water .Some sites along's rim receive almost constant illumination . At thesesunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels , potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings . The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° C when the Sun is overhead , to as low as − 150 ° C during the lunar night .While scientific experiments performed byand could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters , the current evidence is far from definitive . There are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice , as well as to the concentration of this " ore " with depth below the surface . Resolution of this issue will require future missions to the Moon . The presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be " mined " for deposits of hydrogen in water form , a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the Earth .This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope . The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide nearcontinuous power to the observatory . About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5km tallMountain , a peak that isvisible from the Earth , and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped .NASA has named the rim ofas a potential candidate for its lunar outpost , slated to be up and running byand continuously staffed by a crew by. The location would promote self for lunar residents , as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels . Furthermore , the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture . American Beauty is a 1999 American drama film directed by Samand written by Alan Ball . Kevin Spacey stars as Lester, a 42yearold advertising executive who has acrisis when he becomes infatuated with hisdaughter 's best friend , Angela  . costars as Lester 'swife , Carolyn , andBirch plays theirdaughter , Jane . Wes Bentley , Chris Cooper , and Allisonalso feature . The film is described by academics as a satire of American middleclass notions of beauty and personal satisfaction ; analysis has focused on the film 'sof romantic , and paternal love , sexuality , beauty ,, selfliberation , and redemption .Ball began writing American Beauty as a play in the early 1990s , partly inspired by the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial in 1992 . Hethe play after realizing the story would not work on stage . After several years as a television screenwriter , Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry . The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball 's frustratingwriting for several sitcoms .Danand Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks ; the thenfledgling film studio bought Ball 's script for $ 250000 ,several other production bodies . DreamWorks financed the $ 15 million production and served as its North American distributor . American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director' film debut ;after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver ! and,was , nevertheless , only given the job after 20 others were considered and several " Alist " directors turned down the opportunity .Spacey was' first choice for the role of Lester , though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider betterknown actors ; similarly , the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn untiloffered the part towithout DreamWorks ' knowledge . Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros.in Burbank , California , and on location in Los Angeles .' dominant style was deliberate and composed ; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans andto generate tension .Conrad Hall complemented' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent onscreen events . During editing ,made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script .Released in North America on September 17 , 1999 , American Beauty was positively received by critics and audiences ; it was the bestreviewed American film of the year and grossed over $million worldwide . Reviewers praised most aspects of the production , with particular emphasis on, Spacey , and Ball ; criticism focused on the familiarity of the characters and setting . DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase the film 's chances of Academy Award success ; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year , the film won Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor  , Best Original Screenplay , and Best. It was nominated for and won many other awards and honors , mainly for the direction , writing , and acting .Lesteris a middleaged advertising executive and magazine writer whohis job .

"Lester becomes infatuated with Jane 's vain friend , Angela Hayes , after seeing her perform a halftime dance routine at a high school basketball game . He starts having sexual fantasies about Angela , in which red roseare a recurring motif . Carolyn begins an affair with her married business rival ,Kane . When Lester 's boss , Brad , tells him that he is to be laid off , Lester instead blackmails him for $ 60000 andhis job . Lester takes a minimumwage job at a fastfood restaurant , trades in his Toyotafor his dream car , a 1970 Pontiac, and starts working out after heAngela tell Jane that she would find him sexually attractive if he got in shape . He begins smoking marijuana supplied by Ricky . The girls ' friendshipafter Jane starts a relationship with Ricky .

Ricky and Jane find Lester 's body , while Carolyn breaks down crying in the. ACol.returns home , where a gun is shown to be missing from his collection . Lester 's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life ; he says that , despite his death , he is happy because there is " so much beauty " in the world .Scholars and academics have offered many possible readings of American Beauty ; film critics are similarly divided , not so much about the quality of the film , as their interpretations of it . Described by many as about " the meaning of life " or " the hollow existence of the American suburbs " , the film has defied categorization by even the filmmakers .is, saying the script seemed to be about something different each time he read it : " a mystery story , ajourney through American, a series of love stories ; [ ... ] it was about imprisonment , [ ... ] loneliness , [ and ] beauty . It was funny ; it was angry , sad . " The literary critic and author Wayne C.concludes that the filmany one interpretation : " [ American Beauty ] cannot be adequately summarized as ' here is a satire on what 's wrong with American life ' ; that plays down the celebration of beauty . It is more tempting toit as ' a portrait of the beauty underlying Americanand' , but that plays down the scenes of cruelty and horror , and Ball 's disgust with our. It cannot be summarized with either Lester or Ricky 's philosophical statements about what life is or how one should live . " He argues that the problem of interpreting the film is tied with that of finding its center — a controlling voice who " [] all of the choices " . He contends that in American Beauty 's case , it is neithernor Ball .considers the voice to be Ball 's , but even while the writer was " strongly influential " on set , he often had to accept deviations from his vision , particularly ones that transformed the cynical tone of his script into something more optimistic . With "voiceson the original author 's , "says , those who interpret American Beauty " have forgotten to probe for the elusive center " . According to, the film 's true controller is the creative energy " that hundreds of people put into its production , agreeing and, inserting and cutting " . called American Beauty a rite of passage film about imprisonment and escape from imprisonment . Theof Lester 's existence is established through his gray ,workplace andclothing . In these scenes , he is often framed as if trapped , " reiterating rituals that hardly please him " . Hein theof his shower ; the shower stall evokes a jail cell and the shot is the first of many where Lester is confined behind bars or within frames , such as when he is reflected behind columns of numbers on a computer monitor , " confined [ and ] nearly crossed out " . The academic and authorW.argues that Lester 's journey is the story 's center . His sexualthrough meeting Angela is the first of several turning points as he begins to " [ throw ] off the responsibilities of the comfortable life he has come to" . After Lester shares a joint with Ricky , his spirit is released and he begins to rebel against Carolyn . Changed by Ricky 's " attractive , profound confidence " , Lester is convinced that Angela isand sees that he must question his ", suburban existence " ; he takes a job at a fastfood outlet , which allows him toto a point when he could " see his whole life ahead of him " .When Lester is caughtby Carolyn , his angryabout their lack of intimacy is the first time he says aloud what he thinks about her . Bythe issue and Carolyn 's " superficial investments in others " , Lester is trying to " regain a voice in a home that [ only respects ] the voices of mother and daughter " . His final turning point comes when Angela and he almost have sex ; after she confesses her, he no longer thinks of her as a sex object , but as a daughter . He holds her close and "her up " .called it " the most satisfying end to [ Lester 's ] journey there could possibly have been " . With these final scenes ,intended to show Lester at the conclusion of a " mythical quest " . After Lester gets a beer from the, the camera pushes toward him , then stops facing adown which he walks " to meet his fate " . Having begun to act his age again , Lester achieves closure . As heat a family photo , the camera pans slowly from Lester to the kitchen wall , onto which bloodas a gunshot rings out ; the slow pan reflects the peace of Lester 's death . His body is discovered by Jane and Ricky .said that Ricky 's staring into Lester 's dead eyes is " the culmination of the theme " of the film : that beauty is found where it is least expected .Like other American films of 1999 — such as Fight Club , Bringing Out the Dead , and Magnolia , American Beauty instructs its audience to " [ lead ] more meaningful lives " . The film argues the case against conformity , but does not deny that people need and want it ; even the gay characters just want to fit in . Jim and Jim , the' other neighbors , are a satire of " gay " , who " [ invest ] in the " that the film criticizes in heterosexual couples . The feminist academic and authorR.argues that American Beauty uses its " art house "to direct its message ofprimarily to the middle classes , and that this approach is a " cliché ofpreoccupation ; [ ... ] the underlying premise being that the luxury of finding an individual ' self ' through denial andis always open to those wealthy enough to choose , andenough to present themselvesas a rebel . "Professor Roy M.argues that the film 's thematic center is its direction to the audience to " look closer " . The opening combines an unfamiliar viewpoint of the' neighborhood with Lester 's narrated admission that he will soon die , forcing audiences to consider their own mortality and the beauty around them . It also sets a series of mysteries ;asks , " from what place exactly , and from what state of being , is he telling this story ? If he 's already dead , whywith whatever it is he wishes to tell about his last year of being alive ? There is also the question of how Lester has died — or will die . "believes the preceding scene — Jane 's discussion with Ricky about the possibility of his killing her father — adds further mystery . Professor Ann C. Hall; she says by presenting an early resolution to the mystery , the film allows the audience to put it aside " to view the film and its philosophical issues " . Through this examination of Lester 's life ,and death , American BeautyAmerican middle class notions of meaning , beauty and satisfaction . Even Lester 's transformation only comes about because of the possibility of sex with Angela ; he therefore remains a " willing devotee of the popular media 'sofmale sexuality as a sensible route to personal" . Carolyn is similarly driven by conventional views of happiness ; from her belief in " house beautiful " domesticto her car andoutfit , Carolyn 's domain is a "Americanvision of, or Eden " . Theare unaware that they are "philosophically , and devout consumers" who expect the "of American beauty " to give them happiness .argues that " they are helpless in the face of theeconomic and sexual stereotypes [ ... ] that they and their culture have designated for their salvation . "The film presents Ricky as its " visionary , [ ... ] spiritual and mystical center " . He sees beauty in theof everyday life ,as much as he can for fear of missing it . He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed : a plastic bag ,in the wind in front of a wall . He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was " an entire life behind things " ; he feels that " sometimes there 's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can 't take it ... and my heart is going to cave in . "argues that Ricky , in looking past the " cultural" , has " [ grasped ] the of the created world " to see God . As the film progresses , themove closer to Ricky 's view of the world . Lester onlypersonal satisfaction at the film 's end . On theof having sex with Angela , he returns to himself after she admits her. Suddenly confronted with a child , he begins to treat her as a daughter ; in doing so , Lester sees himself , Angela , and his family " for the poor and fragile butcreatures they are " . He looks at a picture of his family intimes , and dies having had anthathim with " wonder , joy , and soulshaking gratitude " — he has finally seen the world as it is .According to Patti, colors are used symbolically throughout the film , none more so than red , which is an important thematic signature that drives the story and " [ defines ] Lester 's arc " . First seen in drab colors that reflect his, Lester surrounds himself with red as hehis individuality . The American Beauty rose is repeatedly used as symbol ; when Lesterabout Angela , she is usually naked and surrounded by rose. In these scenes , the roseLester 's desire for her . When associated with Carolyn , the rose represents a " façade for suburban success " . Roses are included in almost every shot inside the' home , where they signify " a mask covering a bleak ,reality " . Carolyn feels that " as long as there can be, all is well " . She cuts theand puts them in, where they adorn her "vision of what makes for beauty " and begin to die . Thein the vase in the Angela – Lester seduction scene symbolize Lester 's previous life and Carolyn ; the camera pushes in as Lester and Angela get closer , finally taking the— and thus Carolyn — out of the shot . Lester 'sat the end of the film is expressed by rain and the use of red , building to a crescendo that is a deliberate contrast to the release Lester feels . The constant use of red "[ the audience ]" into becoming used to it ; consequently , it leaves the audience unprepared when Lester is shot and his bloodon the wall . argues that American Beauty defines its characters through their sexuality . Lester 's attempts to relive his youth are a direct result of his lust for Angela , and the state of his relationship with Carolyn is in part shown through their lack of sexual contact . Also sexually frustrated , Carolyn has an affair that takes her from " cold" to a moresoul who " [ sings ] happily along with " the music in her car . Jane and Angela constantly reference sex , through Angela 's descriptions of her supposed sexual encounters and the way the girls address each other . Their nude scenes are used to communicate their vulnerability . By the end of the film , Angela 's hold on Jane has weakened until the only power she has over her friend is Lester 's attraction to her . Col.reacts with disgust to meeting Jim and Jim ; he asks , " How come these faggots always have to rub it in your face ? How can they be so? " To which Ricky replies , " That 's the thing , Dad — they don 't feel like it 's anything to beof . "argues that Col.' reaction is not, but an "self " .With other turnofthemillennium films such as Fight Club , In the Company of Men  , American , and Boys Don 't , American Beauty " raises the broader , widely explored issue ofin crisis " . Professor Vincentcharges that in their reinforcement of" against threats posed by war , by, and by feminist andchallenges " , these films present a need to " focus on , and even to privilege " aspects of" deemed '' " . Lester 's transformation conveys " that he , and not the woman , has borne the brunt of [ lack of being ] " and he will not stand for being. Lester 's attempts to " strengthen traditional" conflict with his responsibilities as a father . Although the film portrays the way Lester returns to that role positively , he does not become " thefigure implicitly celebrated in films like Fight Club " .concludes that Lester 's behavior toward Angela is " abut nearly necessary step toward his becoming a father again " . says the film " explicitly affirms the importance of upholding the prohibition against" ; a recurring theme of Ball 's work is his comparison of theagainstand homosexuality . Instead of making an overt distinction , American Beauty looks at how their repression can lead to violence . Col.is soof his homosexuality that it drives him to murder Lester . Ball said , " The movie is in part about how homophobia is based in fear and repression and about what [ they ] can do . " The film implies two desires : Lester 's pursuit of Angela is a manifestation of his lust for his own daughter , while Col.' repression is exhibited through the almostdiscipline with which he controls Ricky . Consequently , Ricky realizes that he can only hurt his father by falsely telling him he is homosexual , while Angela 's vulnerability and submission to Lester reminds him of his responsibilities and the limits of his fantasy . Col.represents Ball 's father , whosehomosexual desires led to his own. Ball rewrote Col.to delay revealing him as homosexual , whichreads as a possible "of Ball 's own patriarchal fantasies " .American Beauty follows a traditional narrative structure , onlywith the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story . Although the plot spans one year , the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death . Jacquelinesays that the plot " occupies [ ... ] no time [ or ] all time " , citing Lester 's claim that life did not flash before his eyes , but that it " stretches on forever like an ocean of time " .argues that a " rhythm of repetition " forms the core of the film 's structure . For example , two scenes have thesitting down to an evening meal , shot from the same angle . Each image is broadly similar , with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester 's newfound assertiveness . Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other . Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra , and the image is reversed later for a similarly "and" scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment .Lester 's fantasies are emphasized byand repetitivemotion shots ;uses doubleandtriplein several sequences , and the score alters to make the audience aware that it is entering a fantasy . One example is thescene — Lester 's first encounter with Angela . While theperform their halftime routine to " On Broadway " , Lester becomes increasinglyon Angela . Time slows to represent his "hypnosis " and Lester begins tothat Angela 's performance is for him alone . " On Broadway " — which provides a conventionalto theaction — is replaced by discordant ,music that lacks melody or progression . Thisscore is important to creating the narrativein the sequence ; it conveys a moment for Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length . The effect is one that Stan Linkto " vertical time " , described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that" a single present stretched out into an enormous duration , a potentially infinite ' now ' that nonetheless feels like an instant " . The music is used like a visual cue , so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela . The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of " On Broadway " andtime .According to Drew Miller of, the soundtrack " [ gives ] unconscious voice " to the characters 'andthe subtext . The most obvious use of pop music " accompanies and gives context to " Lester 's attempts to recapture his youth ; reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960sAmerican repression through music and drugs , Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music .' song choices " progress through the history of American popular music " . Miller argues that although some may be over familiar , there is aelement at work , " making good on [ the film 's ] encouragement that viewers look closer " . Toward the end of the film , Thomas Newman 's score features more prominently , creating " a disturbing tempo " that matches the tension of the visuals . The exception is " Don 't Let ItYou Down " , which plays during Angela 's seduction of Lester . At first appropriate , its tone clashes as the seduction stops . The lyrics , which speak of " castles burning " , can be seen as a metaphor for Lester 's view of Angela — " the, fantasydriven exterior of the ' American Beauty ' " — as it burns away to reveal " the timid , small girl who , like his wife , hasdeveloped a false public self " .In 1997 , Alan Ball resolved to move into the film industry after several frustrating years writing for the television sitcoms Grace Under Fire and. He joined the United Talent Agency , where his representative , Andrew, suggested he write ascript to "[ himself ] to the town as a screenwriter " . Ball pitched three ideas to: two conventional romantic comedies and American Beauty , which he had originally conceived as a play in the early 1990s . Despite the story 's lack of an easilyconcept ,selected American Beauty because he felt it was the one for which Ball had the most passion . While developing the script , Ball created another television sitcom , Oh ,Up . He channeled his anger and frustration at having toto network demands on that show — and during hison Grace Under Fire and— into writing American Beauty .Ball did not expect to sell the script , believing it would act as more of a calling card , but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies .passed the script to several producers , including Danand Bruce Cohen , who took it to DreamWorks . With the help of executives Glennand Bob Cooper , and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner , Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks ; he receivedfrom the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not " iron the [ edges ] out " . In an unusual move , DreamWorks decided not to option the script ; instead , in April 1998 , the studio bought it outright for $ 250000 ,FoxPictures , October Films , MetroGoldwynMayer , andEntertainment . DreamWorks planned to make the film for $ 6 – 8 million . and Cohen involved Ball throughout the film 's development , including casting and director selection . The producers met with about 20 interested directors , several of whom were considered " Alist " at the time . Ball was not keen on the more wellknown directors because he believed their involvement would increase the budget and lead DreamWorks to become " nervous about the content " . Nevertheless , the studio offered the film to Mike Nichols and Robert; neither accepted . In the same year , revived the musicalin New York with fellow director Rob Marshall . Bethof the Creative Artists Agency arranged meetings forwith studio figures in Los Angeles to see if film direction was a possibility .came across American Beauty in a pile of eight scripts at's house , and knew immediately that it was the one he wanted to make ; early in his career , he had been inspired by how the film Paris , Texas  presented contemporary America as a mythic landscape and he saw the same theme in American Beauty , as well as parallels with his own childhood .later met with Spielberg ; impressed by' productions of Oliver ! and, Spielberg encouraged him to consider American Beauty . found that he still had to convince DreamWorks ' production executives to let him direct . He had already discussed the film withand Cohen , and felt they supported him . Ball was also keen ; having seen, he was impressed with' " keen visual sense " and thought he did not make obvious choices . Ball felt thatliked to look under the story 's surface , a talent he felt would be a good fit with the themes of American Beauty .' background alsohim , because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production . Over two meetings — the first with Cooper , Walter, and Laurie MacDonald , the second with Cooper alone —pitched himself to the studio . The studio soon approachedwith a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules — $ 150000 .accepted , and later recalled that after taxes and his agent 's commission , he only earned $ 38000 . In June 1998 , DreamWorks confirmed that it had contractedto direct the film .Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s . In about 1991 – 92 , Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center . He watched the bag for 10 minutes , saying later that it provoked an " unexpected emotional response " . In 1992 , Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial .a comic book telling of the scandal , he was struck by how quickly it had become. He said he " felt like there was a real story underneath [ that was ] more fascinating and way more tragic " than the story presented to the public , and attempted to turn the idea into a play . Ball produced around 40 pages , but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film . He felt that because of the visual themes , and because each character 's story was .. " intensely personal " , it could not be done on a stage . All the main characters appeared in this version , but Carolyn did not feature strongly ; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles .Ball based Lester 's story on aspects of his own life . Lester 's reexamination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid30s ; like Lester , Ball put aside histo work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect . Scenes in Ricky 's household reflect Ball 's own childhood experiences . Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col., a man who " gave up his chance to be himself " . Ball said the script 's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional , but that it camefrom his own outlook on life . He said the juxtaposition produced acontrast , giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone .In the script that was sent to prospective actors and directors , Lester and Angela had sex ; by the time of shooting , Ball had rewritten the scene to the final version . Ball initially rebuffed counsel from others that he change the script , feeling they were being; the finalto alter the scene came from DreamWorks ' thenpresident Walter. He convinced Ball by indicating that in Greek mythology , the hero " has a moment ofbefore [ ... ] tragedy occurs " . Ball later said his anger when writing the first draft had blinded him to the idea that Lester needed to refuse sex with Angela to complete his emotional journey — to achieve redemption .and Cohen asked Ball not to alter the scene right away , as they felt it would be inappropriate to make changes to the script before a director had been hired . Early drafts also included a flashback to Col.' service in the Marines , a sequence that unequivocally established his homosexual. In love with another Marine , Col.sees the man die and comes to believe that he is being punished for the " sin " of being gay . Ball removed the sequence because it did not fit the structure of the rest of the film — Col.was the only character to have a flashback — and because it removed the element of surprise from Col.' later pass at Lester . Ball said he had to write it for his own benefit to know what happened to Col., though all that remained in later drafts was subtext .Ball remained involved throughout production ; he had signed a television show development deal , so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to American Beauty . Ball was onset forand to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming . His originalscenes — in which Ricky and Jane arefor Lester 's murder after being framed by Col.— werein postproduction ; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary , saying they were a reflection of his " anger and cynicism " at the time of writing  . Ball andrevised the script twice before it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first readthrough .The shooting script features a scene in Angela 's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty ; the scene differed from earlier versions , which set it as a " big scene on a freeway " in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body . The change was a practical decision , as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs . The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash , but only half a day was available . Ball agreed , but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky 's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman : " When you see something like that , it 's like God is looking right at you , just for a second . And if you 're careful , you can look right back . " Jane asks : " And what do you see ? " Ricky : " Beauty . " Ball said , " They wanted to cut that scene . They said it 's not important . I said , ' You 're out of your fucking mind . It 's one of the most important scenes in the movie ! ' [ ... ] If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie , that is the line . " Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence ; set in a, it presents a " turning point " for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela . By the end of filming , the script had been through 10 drafts . had Spacey andin mind for the leads from the beginning , but DreamWorks executives were. The studio suggested several, including Bruce Willis , Kevin, or Johnto play Lester , and Helen Hunt or Holly Hunter to play Carolyn .did not want a big star " weighing the film down " ; he felt Spacey was the right choice based on his performances in the 1995 films The and Seven , and 1992 'sGlen Ross . Spacey was surprised ; he said , " I usually play characters who are very quick , veryand smart . [ ... ] I usuallyin dark , sort ofwaters . This is a man living one step at a time , playing by his instincts . This is actually much closer to me , to what I am , than those other parts . "offeredthe role of Carolyn without the studio 's consent ; although executives were upset at, by September 1998 , DreamWorks had entered negotiations with Spacey and.Spacey loosely based Lester 's early ""on Walter. During the film , Lester 's physique improves fromto toned ; Spacey worked out during filming to improve his body , but becauseshot the scenes out of chronological order , Spacey variedto portray the stages . Before filming ,and Spacey analyzed Jack's performance in The , becausewanted Spacey to emulate " the way [] moved , the way he looked , the way he was in that office and the way he was an ordinary man and yet a special man " . Spacey 'sis ato Sunset Boulevard  , which is also narrated inby a dead character .felt it evoked Lester 's — and the film 's — loneliness .recalled women from her youth to inform her performance : " I used toconstantly . You 'd go to church and see how people present themselves on the outside , and then be inside their house and see the difference . "and a hair stylist collaborated to create a "president" hairstyle , andand production designer researched mailorderto better establish Carolyn 's environment of a " spotless suburban manor " . To helpget into Carolyn 's mindset ,gave her music that he believed Carolyn would like . He lentthe Bobbyversion of the song " Don 't Rain on My Parade " , which she enjoyed and persuaded the director to include it for a scene in which Carolyn sings in her car .For the roles of Jane , Ricky , and Angela , DreamWorks gave. By November 1998 ,Birch , Wes Bentley , and Menahad been cast in the parts — in Birch 's case , despite the fact she wasfor her nude scene . As Birch was 16 at the time she made the film , and thus classified as a minor in the United States , her parents had to approve her briefscene in the movie . Child labor representatives and they were on the set for the shooting of the scene . Bentleycompetition from top actors under the age of 25 to be cast . The 2009 documentary My Big Break followed Bentley , and several other young actors , before and after he landed the part . To prepare ,provided Bentley with a video camera , telling the actor to film what Ricky would . Peter Gallagher and Alisonwere cast  after filming began in December 1998 .gavea book of paintings by . He told her , " Your character is in there somewhere . "cut much of Barbara 's dialogue , including conversations between Coloneland her , as he felt that what needed to be said about the pair — their humanity and vulnerability — was conveyed successfully through their shared moments of silence . Chris Cooper plays Colonel, Scott Bakula plays Jim, and Samplays Jim Berkley . Jim and Jim were deliberately depicted as the most normal , happy — and boring — couple in the film . Ball 's inspiration for the characters came from a thought he had after seeing a " bland , boring , heterosexual couple " who wore matching clothes : " I can 't wait for the time when a gay couple can be just as boring . " Ball also included aspects of a gay couple he knew who had the same. insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals , although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater , and the actors could not be present at every one . Severaland suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script . An early scene showing theleaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester 's relationship had reached . Spacey andworked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another ; for example , the scene in which Lester almostCarolyn after the pair argues over Lester 's buying a car was originally " strictly contentious " .Principal photography lasted about 50 days from December 14 , 1998 , to February 1999 . American Beauty was filmed on soundstages at the Warner Bros.in Burbank , California , and at Hancock Park andin Los Angeles . The aerial shots at the beginning and end of the film were captured in, California , and many of the school scenes were shot at South High School in, California ; several extras in the gym crowd were South High students . The film is set in an upper middleclass neighborhood in an unidentified American town . Production designer likened theto, Illinois , but said , " it 's not about a place , it 's about an. [ ... ] The milieu was pretty much, USA —mobile. " The intent was for the setting to reflect the characters , who are also.said , " All of them are very strained , and their lives are. " The' household was designed as the reverse of the' — the former a pristine ideal , butand lacking in " inner balance " , leading to Carolyn 's desire to at least give it the appearance of a " perfect allAmerican household " ; the' home is depicted in " exaggerated darkness [ and ] symmetry " .The production selected two adjacent properties on the Warner's "Street " for theand' homes . The crew rebuilt the houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight — between Ricky and Jane 's bedroom windows , and between Ricky 's bedroom and Lester 's garage . The garage windows were designed specifically to obtain the crucial shot toward the end of the film in which Col.— watching from Ricky 's bedroom — mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex .made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel a sense of familiarity with the shot . The house interiors were filmed on the, on location , and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed . The inside of the' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles ; the inside of the' home was shot in the city 's Hancock Park neighborhood . Ricky 's bedroom was designed to be celllike to suggest his "" personality , while at the same time blending with the hightech equipment to reflect hisside . The production deliberatelythe use of red , as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere . The' home uses cool blues , while the' is kept in a " depressed military palette " . ' dominating visual style was deliberate and composed , with adesign that provided " a sparse , almost surreal feeling — a bright ,, hard edged , near like take on American" ;constantly directed his setto empty the frame . He made Lester 's fantasy scenes " more fluid and graceful " , andmade minimal use of, feeling that stable shots generated more tension . For example , whenused a slow push in to the' dinner table , he held the shot because his training as a theater director taught him the importance of putting distance between the characters . He wanted to keep the tension in the scene , so he only cut away when Jane left the table .did use a handheld camera for the scene in which Col.beats Ricky .said the camera provided the scene with a "[ ... ] offbalance energy " . He also went handheld for theof Ricky 'sfootage .took a long time to get the quality of Ricky 's footage to the level he wanted . For the plasticbag footage ,used wind machines to move the bag in the air . The scene took four takes ; two by the second unit did not satisfy, so he shot the scene himself . He felt his first take lacked grace , but for the last attempt , he changed the location to the front of a brick wall and added leaves on the ground .was satisfied by the way the wall gave definition to the outline of the bag . avoided using closeups , as he believed the technique was; he also cited Spielberg 's advice that he should imagine an audienceat the bottom of the camera monitor , to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a 40foot  screen . Spielberg — who visited the set a few times — also advisednot to worry about costs if he had a " great idea " toward the end of a long working day .said , " That happened three or four times , and they are all in the movie . " Despite Spielberg 's support , DreamWorks andfought constantly over the schedule and budget , although the studiolittle with the film 's content . Spacey ,and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates . American Beauty cost DreamWorks $ 15 million to produce , slightly above their projected sum .was so dissatisfied with his first three days ' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks tothe scenes . He said , " I started with a wrong scene , actually , a comedy scene . And the actors played it way too big : [ ... ] it was badly shot , my fault , badly composed , my fault , bad costumes , my fault [ ... ] ; and everybody was doing what I was asking . It was all my fault . " Aware that he was a novice ,drew on the experience of Hall : " I made a very conscious decision early on , if I didn 't understand something technically , to say , without embarrassment , ' I don 't understand what you 're talking about , please explain it . ' " encouraged some improvisation ; for example , when Lesterin bed beside Carolyn , the director asked Spacey to improvise severalfor the act in each take .said , " I wanted that not just because it was funny [ ... ] but because I didn 't want it to seem. I wanted it to seem like he wasit out of his mouth without thinking . [ Spacey ] is so in control — I wanted him to break through . " Spacey obliged , eventually coming up with 35 phrases , butcould not always keep a straight face , which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times . The production used small amounts of computergenerated imagery . Most of the rosein Lester 's fantasies were added in postproduction , although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed . When Lesterabout Angela in a rose bath , the steam was real , save for in the overhead shot . To position the camera , a hole had to be cut in the ceiling , through which the steam escaped ; it was instead added digitally .American Beauty was edited by Christopherand ;began in the position , but had to leave halfway through postproduction because of a scheduling conflict with Me , Myself and Irene   .and an assistant edited the film for 10 days between the appointments .realized during editing that the film was different from the one he had envisioned . He believed he had been making a " much more whimsical , [ ... ]" film than what came together in the edit suite . Instead ,was drawn to the emotion and darkness ; he began to use the score and shots he had intended toto craft the film along these lines . In total , he cut about 30 minutes from his original edit . The opening included a dream in which Lester imagines himself flying above the town .spent two days filming Spacey against, but removed the sequence as he believed it to be too whimsical — " like abrothers movie " — and therefore inappropriate for the tone he was trying to set . The opening in the final cut reused a scene from the middle of the film where Jane tells Ricky to kill her father . This scene was to be the revelation to the audience that the pair was not responsible for Lester 's death , as the way it was scored and acted made it clear that Jane 's request was not serious . However , in the portion he used in the opening — and when the full scene plays out later —used the score and a reaction shot of Ricky to leave a lingering ambiguity as to his guilt . The subsequent shot — an aerial view of the neighborhood — was originally intended as the plate shot for theeffects in the dream sequence . spent more timethe first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together . Heseveral versions of the opening ; the first edit includedscenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester 's murder , but these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery , and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production .believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film " into an episode ofBlue " . Instead , he wanted the ending to be " a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution " . When Ball first saw a completed edit , it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes . He felt that they were so short that they " didn 't really register " .and he argued , but Ball was more accepting aftercut the sequences completely ; Ball felt that without the scenes , the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that " for all its darkness had a really romantic heart " .Conrad Hall was not the first choice for director of photography ;believed he was " too old and too experienced " to want the job , and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with . Instead ,asked Fred, who turned the job down because he did not like the script . Hall was recommended toby Tom Cruise , because of Hall 's work on Without , which Cruise had executive produced .was directing Cruise 's thenwife Nicole Kidman in the play The Blue Room duringon American Beauty , and had alreadythe whole film . Hall was involved for one month during; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script , and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting. Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters ; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals , which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals .Hall 's approach was to create peaceful compositions that evoked, to contrast with the turbulent onscreen events and allow audiences to take in the action . Hall andfirst discussed the intended mood of a scene , but he was allowed to light the shot in any way he felt necessary . In most cases , Hall first lit the scene 's subject by " painting in " the blacks and whites , before adding fill light , which he reflected fromor white card on the ceiling . This approach gave Hall more control over the shadows while keeping the fill lightand the dark areas free of spill . Hall shot American Beauty in a 239 : 1 aspect ratio in the Super 35 format , usingVision 35 mm film stock . He used Super 35 partly because its larger scope allowed him to capture elements such as the corners of the filled pool in its overhead shot , creating a frame around Angela within . He shot the whole film at the same Tstop  ; given his preference for shooting that wide , Hall favored highspeed stocks to allow for more subtle lighting effects . He usedPlatinum cameras with the company 'sseries of prime andlenses . Hall employedVision and stock for scenes with daylight effects . He had difficulty adjusting to's newly introduced Vision release print stock , which , combined with his contrastheavy lighting style , created a look with too much contrast . Hall contacted, who sent him a batch ofthat was 5 % lower in contrast . Hall used a 1 / 8 inchBlackfilter for almost every scene , which he said inmay not have been the best choice , as the optical steps required to blow Super 35 up for itsrelease print led to a slight amount of degradation ; therefore , thefrom the filter was not required . When he saw the film in a theater , Hall felt that the image was slightly unclear and that had he not used the filter , thefrom the Super 35 –conversion would have generated an image closer to what he originally intended .A shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and.asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence ; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy , so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building , intending to light from the top of the truck . Whenreturned , he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen . He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting ; he lit it from the left , with a large light crossing the actors , and with a soft light behind the camera . Hall felt the consequent wide shot " worked perfectly for the tone of the scene " . Hall made sure to keep rain , or the suggestion of it , in every shot near the end of the film . In one shot during Lester 's encounter with Angela at the' home , Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights ; in another , he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower , intensifying the light  . For the closeups when Lester and Angela move to the, Hall tried to keep rain in the frame , lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester . He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room .Thomas Newman 's score was recorded in Santa Monica , California . He mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm , the inspiration for which was provided by. Newman " favored pulse , rhythm , and color over melody " , making for a morescore than he had previously created . He built each cue around " small ,repeating phrases " — often , the only variety through a " thinning of the texture for eight bars " . The percussion instruments included,,, piano ,, and; also featured were guitars , flute , and world music instruments . Newman also used electronic music and on "" tracks employed more unorthodox methods , such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using amandolin . Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the " moral ambiguity " of the script : " It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve [ that ] .

It received overwhelming praise , chiefly for Spacey ,and Ball . Variety reported that " no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal. " It was the bestreceived title at the Toronto International Film Festival  , where it won the People 's Choice award after a ballot of the festival 's audiences .'s director , Piers, said , " American Beauty was theof the festival , the film most talkedabout . "Writing in Variety , Todd McCarthy said the cast ensemble " could not be better " ; he praised Spacey 's " handling of, subtle sarcasm , and blunt talk " and the way heLester with " genuine feeling " . Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Spacey was at his "and most agile " to date , and Rogerof the Chicago SunTimes singled Spacey out for successfully portraying a man who " doesand foolish things [ but who ] doesn 'thimself " . Kevin Jackson of& Sound said Spacey impressed in ways distinct from his previous performances , the most satisfying aspect being his portrayal of " bothand hero " . Writing in Film Quarterly , Garypraised the actors , but said that characters such as Carolyn and Col.were stereotypes .accusedand Ball of identifying too readily with Jane and Ricky , saying the latter was their " fantasy figure " — aboy who 's anwealthy artist able to " finance [ his ] own projects " .said Angela was the mostteenager , in particular with her "familiar " attempts to " live up to an unworthy image of herself " . Maslin agreed that some characters were unoriginal , but said their detailedmade them memorable . Kennethof the Los Angeles Times said the actors"" with what were difficult roles ; he called Spacey 's performance " the energy that drives the film " , saying the actor commanded audience involvement despite Lester not always being sympathetic . " Against considerable odds , we do like [ these characters ] , "concluded .Maslin felt thatdirected with " terrific visual" , saying hisstyle balanced " theand bright " and that he evoked the " delicate ,powerplaying vignettes " of his theater work . Jackson said' theatrical roots rarely showed , and that the " most remarkable " aspect was that Spacey 's performance did not overshadow the film . He said thatworked the script 'ssmoothly , to the ensemble 's strengths , and staged the tonal shifts. McCarthy believed American Beauty a " stunning card of introduction " for film and Ball . He said' " sure hand " was " as precise and controlled " as his theater work . McCarthy cited Hall 's involvement as fortunate for, as the cinematographer was "" at conveying the themes of a work .agreed that' choice of collaborators was "" , naming Hall and Newman in particular .suggested that American Beauty may have benefited from' inexperience , as his " anything 's possible daring " made him attempt beats that moredirectors might have avoided .felt that' accomplishment was to " capture and enhance [ the ]" of Ball 's script — the simultaneously "[ ... ] andreal " characters ., while critical of many ofand Ball 's choices , admitted the film showed off their " considerable talents " . cited Ball 's lack ofwhen writing the film as the reason for its uniqueness , in particular the script 's subtle changes in tone . McCarthy said the script was " as fresh and distinctive " as any of its American film contemporaries , and praised how it analyzed the characters while notnarrative pace . He called Ball 's dialogue " tart " and said the characters — Carolyn— were " deeply drawn " . One other flaw , McCarthy said , was the revelation of Col.' homosexuality , which he said evoked " " . Jackson said the filmits clichéd setup to become a " wonderfully resourceful andcomedy " . He said that even when the film played for sitcom laughs , it did so with " unexpected nuance " .criticized how the film made a mystery of Lester 's murder , believing itand simply a way of generating suspense . McCarthy cited the production and costume design as, and said the soundtrack was good at creating " ironic counterpoint [ s ] " to the story .concluded that American Beauty was " vital but uneven " ; he felt the film 's examination of " the ways which teenagers and adults imagine each other 's lives " was its best point , and that although Lester and Angela 's dynamic was familiar , its romantic irony stood beside " the most enduring literary treatments " of the theme , such as. Nevertheless ,believed that the film 's themes ofand conformity in Americanwere "" . McCarthy conceded that the setting was familiar , but said it merely provided the film with a " starting point " from which to tell its " subtle andjudged tale " . Maslin agreed ; she said that while it " takes aim at targets that are none too fresh " , and that the theme ofdid not surprise , the film had its own " corrosive novelty " .awarded American Beauty four stars out of four , andsaid it was layered ,, complex , and surprising , concluding it was " a hell of a picture " .A few months after the film 's release , reports of a backlash appeared in the American press , and the years since have seen its critical regard. In 2005 ,named American Beauty as one of 20 " mostmovies of all time " ;accepted theof the critical, saying , " I thought some of it was entirely justified — it was a littleat the time .

Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999 , and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their endofyear lists . The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999 , but while the New York Film Critics Circle , the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty , they gave their top awards to other films . By the end of the year , reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the underdog in the race for Best Picture ; however , at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000 , American Beauty won Best Film , Best Director and Best Screenplay .As the nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards approached , ahad not emerged . DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for American Beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5600 Academy Award voters . Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies . Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited , DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in " casual , comfortable settings " in voters ' communities . The studio 's candidate for Best Picture the previous year , Saving Private Ryan , lost to Shakespeare in Love , so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign . It hired three veteran consultants , who told the studio to " think small " . Nancyencouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of American Beauty , to set up displays of the film in the communities ', and to arrange a questionandanswer session withfor the British Academy of Film and Television Arts . Daleadvised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in Beverly Hills — home to many voters — in addition to major newspapers .arranged to screen American Beauty to about 1000 members of the Actors Fund of America , as many participating actors were also voters . Bruce Feldman took Ball to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival , where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of Anthony Hopkins , meeting several voters who were in attendance .In February 2000 , American Beauty was nominated for eight Academy Awards ; its closest rivals , The Cider House Rules and The, received seven nominations each . In March 2000 , the major industry labor organizations all awarded their top honors to American Beauty ; perceptions had shifted — the film was now the favorite to dominate the Academy Awards . American Beauty 's closest rival for Best Picture was still The Cider House Rules , from. Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns ; DreamWorks bought 38 % more advertising space in Variety than. On March 26 , 2000 , American Beauty won five Academy Awards : Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor  , Best Original Screenplay and Best.

He was appointed to the US Senate by Governor Caleb Strong in 1813 , where he led opposition to the War of 1812 . invested his fortune in a variety of businesses , including important infrastructure projects such as the Middlesex Canal and a bridge across the Charles River . He was a majorin the early textile industry , funding the Boston Manufacturing Company and theManufacturing Company , whose business established the city of Lowell , Massachusetts .was involved in a variety of charitable causes , and was a major benefactor of Harvard College , where the first library was named in his honor . His palatial mansion in, Massachusetts , now known asPlace , is one of the finest extant examples ofarchitecture , and has been declared a National Historic Landmark .Christopherwas born in Boston on September 21 , 1758 , one of many children of Frances and John, a successful merchant and. He was the youngest of their three sons to survive to adulthood . He attended Boston Latin School , and entered Harvard College at the young  age of thirteen . At the outset of the American Revolutionary War and the Siege of Boston in 1775 , Harvard 's buildings were occupied by the Continental Army , andtemporarily continued his studies in Bradford until Harvard could resume operations in Concord . While at Harvardparticipated in a speaking club , and formed significant lifelong friendships with Rufus King and John. graduated in 1776 , and promptly enlisted in the Continental artillery regiment of his brotherinlaw Thomas, where he served as a clerk until 1778 . Thefamily was divided by the war :'s father was awho left Boston when the British Army evacuated the city in March 1776 .was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters , who remained in Boston . In 1779successfully petitioned the state for the remaining family 's share of his father 's seized assets .After his military servicestudied law with John Lowell , and was admitted to the bar in 1778 after a comparatively brief tutelage .'s law practice flourished , in part because manylawyers had fled Massachusetts .'s clients includedseeking to recover some of their assets , as well as Londonbased British merchants with claims to pursue . Hiswere generally wellreasoned , and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer . grew his fortune by investing carefully in revolutionary currency and bonds . Thehe purchased were paper that had been given to Continental Army soldiers in lieu of pay , which they often sold at a steep discount . One batch ofhe purchased , for instance , cost him about $ 3700 but had a face value of $ 25000 . In 1785 he married RebeccaPayne , daughter of a wealthy merchant , maritime, and director of the Bank of Massachusetts . The couple were known for their socialand became prominent members of Boston society .In 1786became concerned about a rise in antilawyer sentiment in Massachusetts .over harsh policies pursued by Governor James into' Rebellion , which required militia action to crush in 1787 .was one of several highprofile lawyers assigned to defend participants in the rebellion  . Although many rebels were ultimately convicted , a large number received amnesty . In 1788 ,was elected a delegate to the 1789 Massachusetts convention that ratified the United States Constitution . His election was contested because Boston , where he lived , was at the time more inclined toward state power .nonetheless was strongly, urging support of the new Constitution .In 1788was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives . He took a leading role in adopting the state 's rules for actions required of it by the new federal constitution . By his proposal the legislature decided that presidential electors would be chosen by a joint session . He also proposed that the state House and Senate agree by separate votes on choices for the United States Senate , a process that would significantly reduce popular input to the choice . His choice was ultimately rejected in favor of a process whereby the House selected a slate of candidates , from which the Senate would choose one . In 1789decided to stand for reelection , but lost , owing to strong antinationalist fervor in Boston at the time . He managed to win a seat later , when a special election was held afteropened several seats . 's financial speculations in the latesignificantly multiplied his wealth . In 1788 he and Andrew, a Boston businessman who had retainedfor legal services , entered into a secret agreement to purchase Continentalwith a face value of $ 100000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise . By late October of that year , the pair had met this goal :had purchased $ 90000 worth of paper for about $ 20000 , and encouragedto purchase more than the $ 11000 he had acquired if his funding would allow for it .also purchased Massachusetts warrelated debts , and lobbied Massachusettsfor the U.S. government to assume those as well . 'swas realized when in 1790 the United States Congress , acting on a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by's friend Rufus King , passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value . Not only didwin on this exchange , but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it . The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents : JohnAdams wrote that's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country .The success of's speculations prompted him to enter a partnership with, Williamand Daniel Parker in an attempt to acquire U.S. foreign debt obligations on favorable terms . Parker was a business partner of's , andwas an influential New York businessman and Treasury Department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed. The partnership promoted sales of U.S. lands in Europe , and sought to acquire U.S. obligations to France . Althoughsank $ 10000 into this venture , it failed : more powerful and experienced Dutch the Americans .also engaged in other ventures with these partners , but apparently carefully stayed with financial speculations , and avoided the partners ' less successful land ventures .Much of's financial activity was mediated through the Bank of Massachusetts , where his fatherinlaw was a director .himself was elected to its board in 1785 , when he also became a shareholder . During his time on the board the bankits regulations on loan, a move that improved the stability of its capital .used the bank for most of his personal deposits , but also drew on lines of credit for as much as several thousand dollars . The bank shares he held paid relatively highuntil 1791 , when the bank received serious competition from the First Bank of the United States .The Bank of the United States was established by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale , and sought to open a branch in Boston . Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts , anddecided to make the move . He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank , and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank . He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank , a relatively large investment .was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch , and sought to merge statechartered banks into the organization , arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service .resigned from the board in 1794 , citing the demands of his law practice . 's financial successes enabled him to join the elite society of Boston . In 1789 he purchased a large mansion on fashionableSquare , and also bought a country estate inthat grew over time to 300 acres  . He had a house built on the estate , most of which he operated as a gentleman farmer . He and other similarlysituatedformed the Massachusetts Society forAgriculture , of which he served as a trustee for several years ; the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances in agriculture .In 1789 President George Washington appointedthe first United States Attorney for Massachusetts as a reward for his support .controversially refused to resign from the state legislature , arguing that the state constitution 's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts . He eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because of pressure from his fellow legislators . served as district attorney until 1796 . His principal matter of concern was the enforcement of U.S. neutrality with respect to the French Revolutionary Wars . He attempted several times tothe French consul in Boston , Antoine, forand operatingout of the Port of Boston , but he wasby localthatwith the French .was eventually expelled on orders from President George Washington based on evidence provided by. also promoted antiFrench sentiment with political writings in Massachusetts newspapers . Writing under the pseudonym "" , he denounced the formation of " Democratic Societies " formed to opposepolicy and support proFrench positions . He suggested to President Washington that someone be sent to England to negotiate with the British . John Jay traveled to London in 1794 and negotiated the Jay Treaty , whose ratificationvocally supported . Althoughwas hostile to French policy , he was on friendly terms with individual Frenchmen : he hosted the future French statesmanwhen he visited the U.S.In 1796 Washington appointed him as a commissioner representing the United States to handle maritime claims under the terms the Jay Treaty . As a result themoved to England that year , establishing a residence in the fashionable Hyde Park area . The commission was established toclaims emanating from Britishof American vessels and cargoes , and from British claims relating to violations of American neutrality in the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars . It consisted of three Americans  and two British commissioners  ;was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently " fairminded " to cast deciding votes in the event of disagreements . That year he was also elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences .Althoughwas well received by the British establishment , the work suffered from whatcalled a "of process " , and he considered requesting a transfer in 1798 . In 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met , and the British stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway .used this break to briefly return to America and assess the condition of hisestate , where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in. After his return to London , with the commission work still stopped , he and Rebecca embarked on a tour of Europe . They visited Holland , Belgium , and Switzerland , and spent six months in Paris . During this trip , and later ones in England and Scotland , they took note of the architecture of country estates , and began planning a new house for theirproperty .The commission resumed its work in early 1802 , and had resolved all outstanding claims by August 1803 . It awarded $ 110000 to British claimants and over $ 6 million to American claimants . The lopsided result is due to the vastly larger number of American claims , but also to some key early decisions that favored American interpretations in the processing of the claims , and by a British administration that sought to remain in America 's good.The's social circle in England revolved around his good friend Rufus King , who was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain in 1796 , along with other Massachusetts expatriates . When King left his post in May 1803 he namedto head the London embassy asd. Although President Thomas Jefferson never issued a formal appointment , the British government accepted his role for the twomonth interval between King 's departure and the arrival of James Monroe as King 's replacement . Thesailed for Boston in the spring of 1804 .Rebeccaused their exposure to European country estates to design a lavish new building for theirestate during their English. Designed with the assistance of French architect JosephGuillaumeand probably also influenced by the works of English architect Sir John, the house that was built upon their return to the United States in 1804  is one of the finest extant examples ofarchitecture .Soon after his return to the United States , state politics , winning election to the Massachusetts Senate . He was active in the stateParty organization , sitting on its secret central committee . He resumed his law practice , in which he took on as a student Daniel Webster . One of the highest profile cases he took on was the 1807 defense of Thomas, accused of murdering Charles Austin ., an olderattorney , had been retained to assist in the collection of a debt from Austin 's Republican father . In the politically charged atmosphere of the day in Boston ,, fearing for his own safety , had armed himself with apistol . The younger Austin had , apparently on his own initiative , sought to beatwith a cane , andfatally shot him in the encounter .wasby Attorney General  James Sullivan , and the defense also included arch Harrison Gray.arguedacted in selfdefense ;was acquitted of murder by a jury whosewasandPaulafter fifteen minutes '. also resumed business activities upon his return . He invested in a wide variety of businesses and infrastructure , spurring economic activity in the state . His investments ranged widely , including maritime insurance  , bridges , locks , canals , and textiles . He was a majorin the Middlesex Canal , theBridge  , and the Boston Manufacturing Company , whose factory proving the singlesite production of textiles was innear his estate . Not all of his ventures panned out : the canal was in the long run a financial failure , as were efforts with other collaborators to developPoint , the Cambridge side of theBridge . The textile mill , however , was a success , andinvested in theManufacturing Company . When it decided to locate in what is now Lowell , Massachusetts ,purchased shares in theofand, which operated  the Lowell canals .In 1806won election to the State Senate . That year the Republicans were in the majority , and the election for governor was close enough to require a. The legislaturethe ballots in a partisan manner  .and otherraised a public, and the legislature relented , eventuallyStrong as the winner . ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Massachusetts in 1807 and 1808 against a rising tide ofin the state , losing both times to moderate Republican James Sullivan . Thegained control of the state legislature in 1808 in a backlash against Republican economic policies , butwas criticized for his failure to aggressively support state protests against theAct of 1807 , which had a major negative effect on the state 's large merchant fleet .was in 1808 elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives , where he successfully ledefforts to ensure the selection of aslate of presidential electors . He also spearheaded actions to drive Senator JohnAdams from theParty over his support of Thomas Jefferson 's foreign policy . The legislature elected Adams ' successor nine months early , and gave Adams sufficientlyinstructions that he resigned the post and joined with the Republicans . led theto victory in 1809 against Sullivan 's successor , Levi Lincoln , Sr. , who had taken over as acting governor upon Sullivan 's death late in 1808 . During's term the principal domestic issue occupying state politics was a banking crisis stimulated by the federal policy oftrade with Great Britain and France , then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars . Although the crisis caused a number of bank failures in New England , Massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed .Foreign policy played a major role in's administration . The legislature passed resolves opposing the federal government 's hardline policy against trade and diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom  , andin early 1810 invited Francis James Jackson , who had been rejected as the UK 's ambassador to the US , to visit the state . This pressure may have played a role in President James Madison 's decision to renew relations with the UK and accept Jackson 's credentials .Theof the war threat , and the choice by the Republicans of the popular Elbridge Gerry as their candidate brought a challenge tocontrol of Massachusetts in the 1810 elections . TheGerry and Republicancriticizedfor his lavish lifestyle , including his palatialresidence andactivities he organized as governor , and highlighted hisfamily connections while emphasizing Gerry 'spatriotism . Gerry won the election . Jackson did visit Boston , but he was greeted not by, but Gerry .ran against Gerry again in 1811 , but lost in anothercampaign . was granted an honorary law degree from Harvard in 1809 . He served on the college 's Board offrom 1810 to 1815 and as a Fellow from 1816 to 1820 . Harvard 's first library building , a Gothic structure built in 1838 ofgranite , was named in his honor , but was demolished whenLibrary was built in its place in 1915 .  One of the residential Winthrop House 's buildings is calledHall in his honor .In the spring of 1813 , he was appointed by Governor Caleb Strong to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Senator James Lloyd . He served from May 5 , 1813 to May 30 , 1816 , winning reelection to the seat in 1814 . He opposed the ongoing War of 1812 in these years , with his earlier diplomatic experience providing valuable knowledge tointerests . He expressed approval of the 1814 Hartford Convention in which the New England states aired grievances concerning Republican governance of the country and the conduct of the war .to the Treaty ofthat ended the war , but was unhappy that the nation had not gained anything from the war . He resigned in June 1816 , unhappy with the politics of Washington and suffering from poor health . Although he was no longer active in politics , he continued to express opinions on the subjects of the day , opposing the 1820 Missouriandthe " great&" ofGovernor John Brooks . remained active in the administration of Harvard , and was active in a number of organizations , including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society  . He was also elected a member of the AmericanSociety in 1814 .spent most of his later years at his country estate in, suffering from worsening that made walking increasingly difficult . His declining health and lack of social scene inled him in 1822 to return to Boston in the winters . He died on March 1 , 1827 in Boston and is buried in its Ground .

Facing a false report of being denounced as a public enemy who was to be executed , he committed suicide on 9 June 68  .

He is known for many executions , including that of his mother , and the probable murder by poison of his . wasto have had captured Christians dipped in oil and set on fire in his garden at night as a source of light . This view is based on the writings of,and , the main surviving sources for's reign , but a few surviving sources paintin a more favourable light . Some sources , including some mentioned above , portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people , especially in the East . Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on'sacts .Lucius ,, was born on 15 December 37 in , near Rome . He was the only son ofandthe Younger , sister of Emperor. 's father ,, was the son of Lucius  andMajor .was thus the grandson of and probably on his father 's side , and the grandson of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor on his mother 's side . Thus ,had as his paternal grandmotherMajor , and also claimed more remote descent fromMinor as a greatgrandson — later grandson after Claudius adopted him .Through Octavia ,was the greatnephew of Caesar Augustus .'s father had been employed as aand was a member of's staff when the latter travelled to the East  .

Octavia was Augustus ' elder sister .was also the adopted son of.poisoned her second husband , so many ancient historians also accuse her of murdering her third husband , the emperor Claudius . was not expected to become Emperor because his maternal uncle ,, had begun his reign at the age of 24 with enough time to produce his own heir .'s mother ,, lost favour withand was exiled in 39 after her husband 's death .seized's inheritance and sent him to be brought up by his less wealthy aunt , , who was the mother of Valeria, Claudius 's third wife ., his wifeand their infant daughter Juliawere murdered on 24 January 41 . These events led Claudius ,'s uncle , to become emperor . Claudius allowedto return from exile .Claudius had married twice before marrying Valeria. His previous marriages produced three children including a son ,, who died at a young age . He had two children with–Octavia  and .was executed by Claudius in the year 48 .In 49 AD , Claudius married a fourth time , to's mother, despite her being his niece .

He was appointed, entered and first addressed the Senate , made joint public appearances with Claudius , and was featured in coinage . In 53 , he married his Octavia .Claudius died in 54 and, taking the nameClaudius Caesar Augustus, was established as Emperor . Though accounts vary , many ancient historians statepoisoned Claudius . According to Pliny the Elder , she used poison mushrooms . It is not known how muchknew or if he was even involved in the death of Claudius . wrote " ... for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor 's death , he was at least privy to it , as he openly admitted ; for he used afterwards tomushrooms , the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius , as " the food of the gods , " as the Greekhas it . At any rate , after Claudius ' death he vented on him every kind of insult , in act and word , charging him now withand now with cruelty ; for it was a favourite joke of his to say that Claudius had ceased " to play the fool " among mortals ,the first syllable of the word, and hemany of his decrees and acts as the work of aand a. Finally , he neglected tothe place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall . "According to;became Emperor at the age of 17 when the news of Claudius ' death was made known , making him the youngest emperor at that time Although , whatmay have meant is that he was in his seventeenth year as his date of birth , also listed by, would have made him 16 at the time of Claudius ' death ., in book XIII of his Annals , describesas being ' scarcely out of his' at the time he became emperor . Ancient historians describe's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother ,, his tutor LuciusSeneca , and the, especially in the first year . Other tutors were less often mentioned , such as Alexander of.Very early in's rule , problems arose from competition for influence betweenand's two main advisers , Seneca and.also attempted to influence the young.also is mentioned by ancient sources as "for her son  " . Thiscontinued as is evidenced by the coin of the both of them . It is extremely unusual to see a women 's face on a coin in the ancient world . It is because of this position of powerfelt jealous as Seneca in particular rose up in's court as he offered the advicewanted to hear unlike his mother .In 54 ,tried to sit down next towhile he met with an Armenian envoy , but Seneca stopped her and prevented ascene  .'s friends also and toldtoof his mother . was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to Octavia and entered into an affair with , a former slave . In 55 ,attempted to intervene in favor of Octavia and demanded that her son dismiss., with the support of Seneca , resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs .With's influence over her son severed , she reportedly began pushing for,'s, to become emperor . Nearly fourteenyearold, heirdesignate prior to's adoption , was still legally a minor , but was approaching legal adulthood . According to,hoped that with her support ,, being the blood son of Claudius , would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over. However , the youth died suddenly and suspiciously on 12 February 55 , the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set . claimed thatdied from anseizure , but ancient historians all claim' death came from's poisoning him ., he enlisted the services of, a woman who specialized in the manufacture of poisons . She devised a mixture to kill, but after testing it unsuccessfully on a slave ,angrily threatened to have her put to death if she did not come up with something usable .then devised a newthat she promised would " killthan a viper . "Her promise was fulfilled afterconsumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine , which had already been, and succumbed within minutes . After the death of,was accused ofOctavia andordered her out of the imperial residence .Over time ,became progressively more powerful , freeing himself of his advisers and eliminating rivals to the throne . In 55 , he removed Marcus Antonius Pallas , an ally of, from his position in the treasury . Pallas , along with, was accused of conspiring against the Emperor to bring to the throne . Seneca was accused of having relations withand. Seneca succeeded in having himself , Pallas andacquitted . According to , at this time , Seneca andreduced their role in governing from careful management to mereof.In 58 ,became romantically involved with , the wife of his friend and future emperor. Reportedly because a marriage toand a divorce from Octavia did not seem politically feasible withalive ,ordered the murder of his mother in 59 . A number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive asdid not marryuntil 62 .Additionally , according to,did not divorce her husband until after's death , making it unlikely that the already marriedwould be pressingfor marriage . Some modern historiansthat's execution ofwas prompted by her plotting to set on the throne . According to,tried to kill his mother through aplanned by histutor. Instead , it took the life of's friend , . Whensurvived , he had her executed byand framed it as a suicide . The incident is also recorded by.In 62 ,'s adviser ,, died .

Seneca askedfor permission to retire from public affairs .divorced and banished Octavia on grounds of infertility , leaving him free to marry the pregnant. After public protests ,was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile , but she was executed shortly after her return . also was reported to have kickedto death in 65 before she could have his second child . However , modern historians , noting,and 's possible bias againstand the likelihood that they did not haveaccounts of private events ,thatmay have died because of complications ofor childbirth . of treason being plotted againstand the Senate first appeared in 62 . The Senate ruled that, a, should be put to death for speaking ill ofat a party . Later ,ordered the exile of whothe Senate in a book .writes that the roots of the conspiracy led bybegan in this year . To consolidate power ,executed a number of people in 62 and 63 including his rivals Pallas , and . According to," showed neither discrimination norin putting to deathhe pleased " during this period . 's consolidation of power also included a slowof authority from the Senate . In 54 ,promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule . By 65 ,complained that they had no power left and this led to theconspiracy .When's wife died in 65 ,went into deep mourning . Her body was not, it waswith spices , embalmed and put in theof Augustus . She was given a state funeral .praised her during the funeraland gave her divine honors . It is said that" burned ten years ' worth of Arabia 's incense production at her funeral .In the beginning of 66 , he married . She was already married when she became's mistress in 65 AD , with's husband being driven to suicide in 66 , socould marry. She was one of the few of's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign .In 67 ,ordered a young,, to beand then married him . According to Dion,bore anresemblance to, andeven called him by his dead wife 's name .Over the course of his reign ,often madethat pleased the lower class .was criticized as being obsessed with personal popularity . began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy . In this first year , he forbade others to refer to him with regard to, for which he was praised by the Senate .was known for spending his time visitingandduring this period .In 55 ,began taking on a more active role as an administrator . He was consul four times between 55 and 60 . During this period , some ancient historians speak fairly well ofand contrast it with his later rule .Under, restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines . Also , fees for lawyers were limited . There was a discussion in the Senate on theof the freedmen class , and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right offreedom .supported the freedmen and ruled that patrons had no such right .The Senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household . Despite riots from the people ,supported the Senate on their measure , and deployed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law . However , he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case .After tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor ,transferred collection authority to lower commissioners .banned any magistrate orfrom exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace . Additionally , there were manyandof government officials along with arrests forand corruption .When further complaints arose that the poor were being overly,attempted to repeal all indirect taxes . The Senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury . As a compromise , taxes were cut from 45 % to 25 % . Additionally , secret government tax records were ordered to become public . To lower the cost of food imports , merchant ships were declared taxexempt .In imitation of the Greeks ,built a number ofand theatres . shows were also held .also established the . The festival included games , poetry , and theater . Historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to. Others considered that to have performers dressed in Greek clothing was old fashioned . Some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment .In 64 , Rome burned .enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction . A number of other major construction projects occurred in's late reign .had the marshes offilled with rubble from the fire . He erected the large . In 67 ,attempted to have a canal dug at the Isthmus of.

He reduced the weight of thefrom 84 per Roman pound to 96  . He also reduced the silver purity from 995 % to 935 % — the silver weight dropping from 383 grams to 34 grams . Furthermore ,reduced the weight of thefrom 40 per Roman pound to 45  .Between 62 and 67 , according tothe Elder and Seneca ,promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile River . It was the first exploration of equatorial Africa from Europe in history . However ,'s expedition up the Nile failed upon reaching the impenetrableof presentday South Sudan .The economic policy ofis a point of debate among scholars . According to ancient historians ,'s construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number ofunderleft Italy " thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money " with " the provinces ruined . " Modern historians , though , note that the period was riddled withand that it is likely that's spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles .The Great Fire of Rome erupted on the night of 18 July to 19 July 64 . The fire started at the southeastern end of the Circusin shops selling flammable goods .The extent of the fire is uncertain . According to, who was nine at the time of the fire , it spread quickly and burned for over five days . It destroyed three of fourteen Roman districts and severely damaged seven . The only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is Pliny the Elder , who wrote about it in passing . Other historians who lived through the period  make no mention of it in what remains of their work .It is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire — whether accident or.and favoras the, so he could build a palatial complex .mentions that Christians confessed to the crime , but it is not known whether thesewere induced by torture . However , accidental fires were common in ancient Rome . In fact , Rome suffered other large fires in 69 and in 80 .It was said byand thatsang the "of" in stage costume while the city burned . Popular legend claims thatplayed theat the time of the fire , an anachronism based merely on the concept of the, ainstrument associated withand his performances . 's account , however , hasinat the time of the fire .also said thatplaying hisand singing while the city burned was only rumor .According to, upon hearing news of the fire ,returned to Rome to organize a relief effort , which he paid for from his own funds .'s contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the, spending days searching the debris without even his. After the fire ,opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless , and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors .In the wake of the fire , he made a new urban development plan . Houses after the fire were spaced out , built in brick , and faced byon wide roads .also built a new palace complex known as the in an area cleared by the fire . This included lush artificial landscapes and a 30metertall statue of himself , theof. The size of this complex is debated  . To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction , tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire . , in one of the earliest nonChristian references to the origins of Christianity , notes that the population searched for aand rumors heldresponsible . Toblame ,targeted Christians . He ordered Christians to be thrown to dogs , while others wereand burned . enjoyed driving a onehorse chariot , singing to theand poetry . He even composed songs that were performed by otherthroughout the empire . At first ,only performed for a private audience .In 64 AD . ,began singing in public inin order to improve his popularity . He also sang at the second in 65 . It was said that the attention , but historians also write thatwas encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his inner circle and the people . Ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform , calling it. was persuaded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance . As a competitor ,raced a tenhorse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it . He also performed as an actor and a singer . Though in his racing  and acting competitions , he won these crowns nevertheless andthem when he returned to Rome . The victories are attributed to the judges and his status as emperor .Shortly after's accession to the throne in 54 , the Roman vassal kingdom of Armeniatheir Iberian princeand he was replaced with theprince. This was seen as ainvasion of Roman territory . There was concern in Rome over how the young Emperor would handle the situation .reacted by immediately sending the military to the region under the command of. Thetemporarily relinquished control of Armenia to Rome .The peace did not last and fullscale war broke out in 58 . ThekingI refused to remove his brotherfrom Armenia . Thebegan a fullscale invasion of the Armenian kingdom . Commanderresponded and repelled most of thearmy that same year .retreated and Rome again controlled most of Armenia . was acclaimed in public for this initial victory ., anoble raised in Rome , was installed byas the new ruler of Armenia .was appointed governor of Syria as a reward .In 62 ,invaded theprovince of.

There was anxiety in Rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit .The result was a deal whereagain became the Armenian king , but was crowned in Rome by Emperor. In the future , the king of Armenia was to be aprince , but his appointment required approval from the Romans .was forced to come to Rome andin ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance .This peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory forpolitically .became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with theas well . The peace betweenand Rome lasted 50 years until Emperor Trajan of Rome invaded Armenia in 114 .The war withwas not's only major war but he was both criticized and praised for an aversion to battle . Like many emperors ,faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire .Britishof 60 – 61 In 60 , a major rebellion broke out in the province of Britannia . While the governorand his troops were busy capturing the island of Mona  from the, the tribes of the southeast staged a revolt led by queenof the.and her troops destroyed three cities before the army ofcould return , receive reinforcements , and quell the rebellion in 61 . Fearinghimself would provoke further rebellion ,replaced him with the more passive.The of 65In 65 ,, a Roman statesman , organized a conspiracy againstwith the help of and , aand aof theGuard . According to, many conspirators wished to " rescue the state " from the emperor and restore the Republic . The discovered the conspiracy and reported it to's secretary ,. As a result , the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including, the poet .'s previous advisor , Seneca was ordered to commit suicide after admitting he discussed the plot with the conspirators .The First Jewish War of 66 – 70In 66 , there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension . In 67 ,dispatchedto restore order . This revolt was eventually put down in 70 , after's death . This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem .In March 68 ,Julius, the governor of Gallia, rebelled against's tax policies . LuciusRufus , the governor ofSuperior , was ordered to put down's rebellion . In an attempt to gain support from outside his own province ,called upon, the governor of , to join the rebellion and further , to declare himself emperor in opposition to.At the Battle ofin May 68 ,' forces easily defeated those ofand the latter committed suicide . However , after putting down this one rebel ,'attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor .refused to act against, but the discontent of theof Germany and the continued opposition ofin Spain did notwell for him .Whilehad retained some control of the situation , support forincreased despite his being officially declared a public enemy . The prefect of theGuard ,, also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for.In response ,fled Rome with the intention of going to the port ofand , from there , to take a fleet to one of the stillloyal eastern provinces . According to,abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands , responding with a line from's: " Is it soa thing then to die ? "thenwith the idea of fleeing to, throwing himself upon the mercy of, or to appeal to the people and beg them to pardon him for his past offences " and if he could nottheir hearts , tothem at least to allow him the prefecture of Egypt " .reports that the text of this speech was later found in's writing desk , but that henot give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the. returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace . After sleeping , heat about midnight to find the palace guard had left .messages to his friends ' palace chambers for them to come , he received no answers . Upon going to their chambers personally , he found them all abandoned . When he called for aor anyone else adept with a sword to kill him , no one appeared . He cried , " Have I neither friend nor? " and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber .Returning ,sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts . An imperial,, offered his villa , located 4 miles outside the city . Travelling in disguise ,and four loyal freedmen ,,,, and, reached the villa , whereordered them to dig a grave for him .At this time , aarrived with a report that the Senate had declareda public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the. The Senate actually was still reluctant andon the right course of action aswas the last member of the Julio Family . Indeed , most of thehad served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline , if not tohimself . The men actually had the goal of returningback to the Senate , where the Senate hoped to work out a compromise with thegovernors that would preserve's life , so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced . , however , did not know this , and at the news brought by the, he prepared himself for suicide , pacing up and down"" which translates to English as " What an artist dies in me . "his, he firstfor one of his companions to set an example by first killing himself . At last , the sound of approaching horsemen droveto face the end . However , he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary ,, to perform the task .When one of the horsemen entered , upon his seeingall but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain .'s final words were " Too late ! This is fidelity ! " He died on 9 June 68 , the anniversary of the death of Octavia , and was buried in theof the , in what is now the Villa area of Rome .With his death , the Julio dynasty ended . The Senate , when news of his death reached Rome , posthumously declareda public enemy to appease the coming and proclaimedthe new emperor . Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four.According toand , the people of Rome celebrated the death of., though , describes a more complicated political environment .mentions that's death was welcomed by Senators , nobility and the upper class . The lowerclass , slaves ,of the arena and the theater , and " those who were supported by the famous excesses of" , on the other hand , were upset with the news . Members of the military were said to have mixed feelings , as they had allegiance to, but wereto overthrow him .Eastern sources , namelyII andof, mention that's death wasas he " restored the liberties ofwith a wisdom andquite alien to his character " and that he " held our liberties in his hand and respected them . "Modern scholarship generally holds that , while the Senate and more welloff individuals welcomed's death , the general populace was " loyal to the end and beyond , forandboth thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia . " 's name was erased from some monuments , in what Edwardregards as an " outburst of private zeal " . Many portraits ofwere reworked to represent other figures ; according to Eric R., over fifty such images survive . This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously  ., however , doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images oflong after his death .The civil war during the year of the Fourwas described by ancient historians as aperiod . According to, this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline , asand those before him could .began his short reign with the execution of many allies ofand possible future enemies . One such notable enemy included , who claimed to be the son of Emperor. .was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of's and resembled him somewhat in temperament . It was said that the common Roman hailedashimself .used "" as a surname andmany statues to..began his reign with a large funeral forcomplete with songs written by.After's suicide in 68 , there was a widespread belief , especially in the eastern provinces , that he was not dead and somehow would return . This belief came to be known as the Legend .The legend of's return lasted for hundreds of years after's death . Augustine ofwrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422 .At least three emerged leading rebellions . The first , who sang and played theorand whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor , appeared in 69 during the reign of. After persuading some to recognize him , he was captured and executed .during the reign of Titus  , anotherappeared in Asia and sang to the accompaniment of theand looked likebut he , too , was killed . Twenty years after's death , during the reign of, there was a third. He was supported by the, who onlygave him up , and the matter almost came to war .In his book The Lives of the Twelve,describesas " about the average height , his body marked with spots and, his hair light blonde , his features regular rather than attractive , his eyes blue and somewhat weak , his neck over thick , his belly prominent , and his legs very slender . "The history of's reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with. These first histories at one time did exist and were described as biased and, either overly critical or praising of. The original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events . Nonetheless , these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories onwritten by the next generations of historians . A few of the contemporary historians are known by name . ,Rufus and Pliny the Elder all wrote condemning histories onthat are now lost . There were also pro histories , but it is unknown who wrote them or for what was praised .The bulk of what is known ofcomes from,and , who were all of theclass .andwrote their histories onover fifty years after his death , while wrote his history over 150 years after's death . These sources contradict on a number of events in's life including the death of Claudius , the death of, and the Roman fire of 64 , but they are consistent in their condemnation of.A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on. Few surviving sources paintin a favourable light . Some sources , though , portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people , especially in the east .  was the son of , a Roman senator . He passed the greater part of his life in public service . He was a senator underand governor ofafter the death of Septimius; and afterwardsconsul around 205 , and alsoin Africa and.Books 61 – 63 of's Roman History describe the reign of. Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John, an 11thcentury monk .  , a Greek philosopher and historian , wrote the Roman people were very happy withand would have allowed him to rule indefinitely . Theyfor his rule once he was gone and embracedwhen they appeared :Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet ; for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned , there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time , seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive . And the great majority do believe that he still is , although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive .  was the slave to's . He makes a few passing negative comments on's character in his work , but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule . He describesas a spoiled , angry and unhappy man .The historian , while callinga, was also the first to mention bias against. Of other historians , he said :But Iany further discourse about these affairs ; for there have been a great many who have composed the history of; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour , as having received benefits from him ; while others , out of hatred to him , and the great illwill which they bore him , have so against him with their lies , that theydeserve to be condemned . Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of, since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time , even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred , since those writers lived a long time after them .Though more of a poet than historian , has one of theaccounts of's rule . He writes of peace and prosperity underin contrast to previous war and. Ironically , he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrowand was executed . II " the"  spoke ofin the Life of  . Though he has a generally bad or dim view of, he speaks of others ' positive reception ofin the East .Pliny the ElderThe history ofby Pliny the Elder  did not survive . Still , there are several references toin Pliny 's Natural. Pliny has one of the worst opinions ofand calls him an " enemy of mankind . "  mentionsindirectly in his account of the Life ofand the Life of.is portrayed as a, but those that replace him are not described as better .Seneca the YoungerIt is not surprising that Seneca  ,'s teacher and advisor , writes very well of.  was a member of theorder , and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence . While in this position ,started writing biographies of the emperors ,theand sensational aspects .The Annals by is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of, despite being incomplete after the year 66 .described the rule of the Julio emperors as generally unjust . He also thought that existing writing on them was:The histories of,, Claudius and, while they were in power , were falsified through terror , and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred . was the son of a, who married into the elite family of. He entered his political life as a senator after's death and , by' own admission , owed much to's rivals .that this bias may be apparent to others ,protests that his writing is true . Inpublished in Basel his , which was one of the first historical references of the Modern era to portrayin a positive light .At the end of 66 , conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea . According to the Talmud ,went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions . All the arrows landed in the city . He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day . The child responded , " I will lay my vengeance uponby the hand of my people Israel "  .became, believing that God wanted the Temple in Jerusalem to be destroyed , but would punish the one to carry it out .said , " He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me , " whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such.was then dispatched to put down the rebellion .The Talmud adds that the sage Baal, Rabbior RabbiBaal was a Jewish sage who lived in the time of thea prominent supporter of the Barrebellion against Roman rule . He was considered one of the greatest of theof the third generation  . According to the Talmud , his father was a descendant of the Roman Emperorwho had converted to Judaism . His wifeis one of the few women cited in the. He is the third most frequently mentioned sage in the.Roman and Greek sources nowhere report's alleged trip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism . There is also no record ofhaving any offspring who survived infancy : his only recorded child ,Augusta , died aged 4 months .NonChristian historiandescribesextensivelyand executing Christians after the fire of 64 .also mentionspunishing Christians , though he does so because they are " given to a new and mischievous superstition " and does not connect it with the fire .Christian writer was the first to callthe firstof Christians . He wrote , "your records . There you will find thatwas the first that persecuted this doctrine " . also said that" first persecuted the servants of God " . as does .

The stadium , which was previously unfit for international matches , had undergone a major renovation program prior to the match . The Football Stadium now regularly hosts matches of the United Football League . The stadium also hosted its first rugby test when it hosted the 2012 Asian Five Nations Division I tournaments .The government of Manila is divided into three branches : executive , legislative and judiciary . The judicial branch is administered solely by the Supreme Court of the Philippines under the Metro Manila judicial region . The city government have control of the executive and legislative branch . Manila employs 11 personnel at the end of 2014 .The current Mayor of Manila is Joseph, who served as the President of the Philippines from 19982001 .

Their offices are located at the Manila City Hall .On September 25 , 2014 , the Commission onreleased its 2013 Annual Financial Report citing the city 's income at101 billion with an asset worth of186 billion . Its local income stood at541 billion and its national government allocation was174 billion , having an annual regular income  of an estimated715 billion . Manila 's net income stood at354 billion in 2014 .Among the local government units , Manila has the highest budget allocation to health . It was also one of the cities with the highest tax and internal revenue . Tax revenue accounts for 46 % of the city 's income in 2012 .Manila has six legislative districts that serve as the constituencies for the election of the city 's representatives to the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines and of the regular members to the  . Each district elects one representative to the House of Representatives and sixmembers to the council . The city , along with the rest of the nation , elects 12as one atlarge district .Manila is politically divided into , the smallest unit of local government in the Philippines . Eachhas its ownand. For administrative convenience , all thein Manila are grouped into 100 zones . These zones have no form of local government .The 1st District  is Manila 's  most densely populated congressional district . It covers the western portion ofthat lies along Manila Bay .The 2nd District  covers the eastern inland portion of, a neighborhood or subdistrict known as.The 3rd District  covers,, San Nicolas and Santa Cruz .The 4th District  covers.The 5th District  covers,, Port Area ,, San Andres, and a portion of .The 6th District  covers ,, San Miguel , Santaand Santa Mesa .Manila has the most number ofof any city or municipality in the Philippines . Attempts at reducing its number have not prospered despite local legislation — , passed on 23 April 1996 — reducing the number fromto 150 by merging existing, because of the failure to hold a.Manila , being the seat of political power of the Philippines , has several national government offices headquartered at the city . Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of American colonization to the country when they envisioned a welldesigned city outside the walls of. The strategic location chosen was, a former town which is now thePark to become the center of government and a design commission was given to Danielto create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington.. These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L..A new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila , or what is nowCity . Several government agencies have set up their headquarters inCity but several key government offices still reside in Manila . However , many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations .The city , as the capital , still hosts the Office of the President , as well as the president 's official residence . Aside from these , important institutions such as the Supreme Court , the Court of Appeals , the , theofand Management , Finance , Health , Justice , Labor andand Public Works and Highways still call the city home . Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library , National Archives , National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital .Congress previously held office at the Old Congress Building . In 1972 , due to declaration of martial law , Congress was dissolved ; its successor , the unicameral , held office at the new Complex . When a new constitution restored theCongress , the House of Representatives stayed at the Complex , while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building . In May 1997 , the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at.Water services used to be provided by the MetropolitanandSystem , which served 30 % of the city with most other sewage being directly dumped into storm drains ,tanks , or open canals .wasin 1997 which split the water concession into the east and west zones . TheWater Services took over the west zone of which Manila is a part . It now provides the supply and delivery ofwater andsystem in Manila , but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water . Electric services are provided by, the sole electric power distributor in Metro Manila .One of the more famous modes of transportation in Manila is the.after U.S. army, these have been in use since the years immediately following World War II . The , the third generation Toyota, which competed directly withand followed fixed routes for a set price , once plied the streets of Manila .On a forhire basis , the city is served by numerous, ""  , and "" or ""  . In some areas , especially in, are popular . Spanishera horsedrawnare still a popular tourist attraction and mode of transportation in the streets ofand. All types of public road transport are privately owned and operated under government franchise .The city is serviced by the 1 and 2 which forms thesystem , as distinct from the 3 which is under thesystem that services other parts of Metro Manila . Development of the railway system began in the 1970s under the Marcos administration , making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia . These systems are currently undergoing a multibilliondollar expansion .Line 1 runs along the length of Taft Avenue  andAvenue  , and theLine 2 runs alongM.Avenue  and RamonBoulevard  from Santa Cruz , throughCity , up toin.The main terminal of the Philippine National Railways lies within the city . One commuter railway within Metro Manila is in operation . The line runs in a general northsouth direction from toward. The Port of Manila , located in the vicinity of Manila Bay is the chief seaport of the Philippines . TheRiver Ferry Service which runs on theRiver is another form of transportation . The city is also served by the International Airport and Clark International Airport .In 2006 , Forbes magazine ranked Manila " the world 's mostcity " . Manila has become notorious for its frequent traffic jams and high densities . The government has undertaken several projects to alleviate the traffic in the city . Some of the projects include : the construction of a new flyover at, the construction of the Metro ManilaStage 3 , the proposedLine 2  extension fromtoor the Port Area , and the expansion of several national and local roads . However , such projects have yet to make any meaningful impact , and the traffic jams and congestion continue unabated . The urban planning of the Manila and the whole metropolis was based on the Metro Manila Dream Plan , which seeks to address the problems of Metro Manila 's urban planning and transportation . It consists of a list of short term priority projects and medium to long term infrastructure projects that will last up to.The Manila Health Department is responsible for the planning and implementation of the health care programs provided by the city government . It operates 59 health centers and six cityrun hospitals , which are free of charge . The six public cityrun hospitals are theMedical Center ,,AndresMemorial Medical Center ,,.Hospital , and Justice JoseSantos General Hospital . Manila is also the site of the Philippine General Hospital , the tertiary stateowned hospital administered and operated by the University of the Philippines Manila .Manila 's healthcare is also provided by private corporations . Private hospitals that operates in the city are the Manila Doctors Hospital , Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center , Dr. José R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center , Metropolitan Medical Center , Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital , and the University of Santo Tomas Hospital .The Department of Health has its main office in Manila . The national health department also operates the SanHospital , a special referral tertiary hospital . Manila is also the home to the headquarters of the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific and the World Health Organization Country Office for the Philippines .The center of education since the colonial period , Manila — particularly— is home to several Philippine universities and colleges as well as its oldest ones . It served as the home of the University of Santo Tomas  ,de San Juan de ,de Manila University  , Lyceum of the Philippines University and theInstitute of Technology . Onlyde San Juan de remains at; the University of Santo Tomas transferred to a new campus atin 1927 , andleftfor Loyola Heights ,City  in 1952 .The University of the City of Manila  located at, andde Manila located just outside the walled city , are both owned and operated by the Manila city government . The national government controls the University of the Philippines Manila , the oldest of the University of the Philippines constituent universities and the center of health sciences education in the country . The city is also the site of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines , the largest university in the country in terms of student population .The University Belt refers to the area where there is a high concentration or a cluster of colleges and universities in the city and it is commonly understood as the one where the San Miguel ,anddistricts meet . Generally , it includes the western end ofBoulevard ,Reyes St.  , the eastern end ofM.Avenue  ,Avenue ,Street , and the different side streets . Each of the colleges and universities found here are at a short walking distance of each other . Another cluster of colleges lies along the southern bank of theRiver , mostly at theanddistricts , and still a smaller cluster is found at the southernmost part ofnear the border withsuch as the private coeducational institution of De La Salle University , the largest of all De La Salle University System of schools .The Division of the City Schools of Manila , a branch of the Department of Education , refers to the city 's threetier public education system . It governs the 71 public elementary schools , 32 public high schools .The city also contains the Manila Science High School , the pilot science high school of the Philippines ; the National Museum , where theof Juanis housed ; the Metropolitan Museum of Manila , a museum of modern and contemporary visual arts ; the , the Children 's Museum , a place of handson discovery and fun learning ; and , the National Library , theof the country 's printed and recorded cultural heritage and other literary and information resources .Sister cities of Manilais a large genus ofnative to Mexico , the Caribbean , Central and South America . This , nonspiny genus includes both smalllacking anstem and large trees . The genus has a complicated taxonomic history , and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers . Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers , the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus . This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny .Somewhere between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus , with estimates of as many as 100 . collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species , or groups of similar species .species have a long history of human use , and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre . Many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats . Their seeds are animal dispersed , including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by nowextinct Pleistocene.The genushascompound leaves — rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a featherlike or like pattern . Species are also nonspinyand includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres  tall and  . The number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirtyfive ; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves . are large , branched and borne among the leaves . Theconsists of a main axis — theand the— and a series of smaller branches , the. The, which bear the flowers , emerge from the. Theis the main stalk , connecting thewith the stem .either consist entirely of male flowers , or are predominantly female with a few male flowers . Fruit usually have two or three seeds , although fewer or more are present in some species , and are usually brown , yellow , orangebrown or purple when mature .Four different types of male flowers exist . On the basis of these flower types , the genus has often been split into four genera — a more narrowly defined,,and. The species sometimes referred tohave coiled, while the other groups have straight ones . Theof those placed inare much shorter than the, while those placed inand a more narrowly definedhavethat are longer than the. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups ; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus . has been placed in the subfamily, the tribeand the , together with the genera,,,,,,,,and. Within this,has been found to be a monophyletic group , and sister to the clade containing,,,and. exists as to whethershould be considered a single genus , or a group of related genera . In their 1996 Field Guide to theof the Americas , Andrew Henderson , Gloriaand combined all the species in the  into a single genus ,. In his 1999Treatment of Palm , American botanist Sidney F.divided the group into five genera — a more narrowly defined,,,and. and Johnrecognised a single genus in their 2005 Worldof, and JeanChristophecontinued this usage in his 2008 review of the genus .The multigenus approach is based solely on the structure of the male flowers ; no other characters could be consistently associated with one genus or another . Four of the genera — ,,and— correspond to four different types of male flowers found within the genus . However , a few species have flowers that are intermediate between these four types , including A. and this has been used as an argument for the singlegenus approach . In addition , there are several hybrids between species that would be considered different genera under's fivegenus system , which has also been used as an argument for placing them in a single genus . In 2009 Alanand colleagues published a molecular phylogeny of thewhich found that some species placed inwere actually more closely related to species placed inthan they were to other members of that genus  , while A., placed inby, was actually a sister to bothand.The genuswas first described Carl in 1816 based on specimens collected by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé, although older , pre descriptions exist , including Charles's 1703 description of A.. The genus was named forIII, king of, known for his interest inplants . The type species is A., a Colombian endemic . The generaandwere described by Carl Friedrich Philipp vonin 1826 and 1837 respectively .was described by Hermannin 1857 , andbyF. Cook in 1942 .Experts disagree about the number of species in the genus . In 1965 , DutchJan GerardBoer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus . In their 1996 Field Guide to theof the Americas Andrew Henderson andrecognised 29 species in the genus , while Sidneyrecognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group . Largely following's lead , and Johnrecognised 67 species in their 2005 Worldof. An important element of this disagreement is the decision byto define species more narrowly than Henderson . As a result , what Henderson interpreted as variation within species ,took as differences betweensimilar species . This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented incollections . The large size of the leaves , inflorescences and fruit of manyspecies makes them difficult to collect . In addition , many important collections , including type specimen , have been lost or destroyed .or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species .The three recent treatments  recognised a total of 73 species , but only 20 species are accepted by all of them . The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40 . For example , what Andrew Henderson considered a single species , , other authors have considered a species complex consisting of four or five species .doubted the validity of A.as a species , and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A.— A., A., A.and A..andaccepted both's four species and A.. However , JeanChristophewas of the opinion that A., A.and A.were all very similar , and thought it likely that they all represented the same species .Another species complex inincludes A.and related species . Henderson  recognised A.and A., considering the latter to either be anform of A.or a hybrid between it and A..andaccepted A., butconsidered it a dubious taxon . was recognised as a distinct species by Michaeland;andandconcurred , but Henderson considered it part of A..also described a fourth member of this group , A., and it is accepted byand. species are— male and female flowers are separate , but are borne by the same plant . Various species have been described as being insect , including A., whilein A.and A., has been attributed both to insects and wind .is remote tubular — during, as theexpands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed . After, the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce thestem . This produces a " saxophone shaped "portion of the stem . The fact that the shoot tips ofseedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their firetolerance .Species range across thefrom Mexico in the north to Bolivia , Paraguay , and southern Brazil in the south . According toand, three species are found in Mexico , four in Central America , and 62 in South America . Three species are present in the Caribbean — two in Trinidad and, along the southern edge of the region , and one in Haiti . includes both large trees and small which occupy a number of different ecological niches .stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape , while smaller species are found in both in the forestand in. has been implicated in the formation of vegetation dominated by largespecies .

Ray JohnstonThe film was the final production and release of the Thanhouser Company and it was to be released through. Numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser . Q. David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser 's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases throughwere based on their decision to release orthe work , the New Rochelle studio was 2500 miles from the center of the trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released , Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio 's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the,B. Bishop . The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan , the scenario writer of the company , had retired from the company . As it wound down , the Thanhouser Company was announced to have nowould close with a positive bank balance . Little is known of the production of this final film , but it was directed by Emilefrom a scenario written by Lloyd F. Lonergan . The cameraman was Jacques.The five reel film was released through theExchange as aGold Rooster Play on October 7 , 1917 . Charles E. Wagner of the's Trade Review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography , but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real . Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual; which should prove a strong program for theprogram . Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences , but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer . A reviewer for the The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film 's excessive use ofmeetings to be highly, but found's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances . The reviewer said that Emilehad made thestory more plausible .Like many American films of the time , The Heart of Ezra Greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards . The Chicago Board ofrequired the cutting in2 of a letter stating , " I cannot face my father , " etc . , and twoof gambling scenes ; and in5 a change of the" Because it means her whole future " to " Because she is his wife " . Free Derry  was a selfdeclared autonomous nationalist area of Derry , Northern Ireland , that existed between 1969 and 1972 . Its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in thein January 1969 which read , " You are now entering Free Derry " . The area , which included theandneighbourhoods , was secured by community activists for the first time on 5 January 1969 following an incursion into theby members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary  . Residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent thefrom entering . After six days the residents took down the barricades andpatrols resumed , but tensions remained high over the following months .Violence reached a peak on 12 August 1969 , culminating in the Battle of the— a threeday pitched battle between residents and the. On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of theand thewere withdrawn . The Derry Citizens Defence Association  declared their intention to hold the area against both theand the British Army until their demands were met . The British Army made no attempt to enter the area . The situation continued until October 1969 when , following publication of the Hunt Report , military police were allowed in .The Irish Republican Army  began to rearm and recruit after August 1969 . In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Both were supported by the people of the Free Derry area . Meanwhile , relations between the British Army and the nationalist community , which were initially good , deteriorated . In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops . The government introducedon 9 August 1971 , and in response , barricades went up once more in theand. This time , Free Derry was a nogo area , defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA . From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army , and thebegan a bombing campaign in the city centre . As before , unarmed '' manned the barricades , and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police .Support for the IRA increased further after Bloody Sunday in January 1972 , when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the British Army 's Parachute Regiment at a march in the . The support began toafter the killing by the Official IRA of a local youth who was home on leave from the British Army . After a Provisional IRA ceasefire , during which it entered talks with the British government , broke down , the British took the decision to move against the " nogo " areas . Free Derry came to an end on 31 July 1972 , when thousands of British troops moved in with armoured cars andto occupy the area .Derry City lies near the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . It has a majority nationalist population , and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections . Despite this , the Ulster Unionist Party controlled the local council ,Corporation , from 1923 onwards . Themaintained their majority , firstly , by manipulating the constituency boundaries  so that the South Ward , with a nationalist majority , returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward andWard , with unionist, returned twelve councillors between them ;, by allowing onlyto vote in local elections , rather than one man , one vote , so that a higher number of nationalists , who did not own homes , were disenfranchised ; and, by denying houses to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency . The result was that there were about 2000 nationalist families , and practically no unionists , on the housing waiting list , and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition . The South Ward comprised the,,, Bishop Street and Foyle Road , and it was this area that would become Free Derry .The Derry Housing Action Committee  was formed in March 1968 by members of the Derry Branch of the Northern Ireland Labour Party and the JamesRepublican Club , including and . It disrupted a meeting ofCorporation in March 1968 and in May blocked traffic by placing a caravan that was home to a family of four in the middle of theRoad in theand staging a sitdown protest at the opening of the second deck of theBridge . After the meeting ofCorporation was again disrupted in August , telephoned the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  and invited them to hold a march in Derry . The date chosen was 5 October 1968 , ancommittee was formed  and the route was to take theinside the city walls , where nationalists were traditionally not permitted to march . The Minister of Home Affairs , William Craig , made an order on 3 October prohibiting the march on the grounds that theBoys of Derry were intending to hold a march on the same day . In the words of Martinof" this particular tactic ... provided the excuse needed to ban the march . " When theattempted to defy the ban on 5 October they were stopped by a Royal Ulster Constabulary  cordon . The police drew theirand struck, includingMP Eddieand Westminster MP Gerry. Subsequently the police " broke ranks and used their on people in Duke Street " .trying to escape met another party of police and " these police also used their . " Water cannons were also used . The police action caused outrage in the nationalist area of Derry , and at a meeting four days later the Derry Citizens ' Action Committee  was formed , with John Hume as chairman and Ivan Cooper as vicechairman .Another group formed as a result of the events of 5 October was People 's Democracy , a group of students in Queen 's University Belfast . They organised a march from Belfast to Derry in support of civil rights , starting out with about forty young people on 1 January 1969 . The march met with violent opposition from loyalist counterdemonstrators at several points along the route . Finally , atBridge , five miles outside Derry , they were attacked by a mob of about two hundred wielding clubs — some of them studded with nails — and stones . Half of the attackers were later identified from press photographs as members of the B . The police , who were at the scene ,to the B as they prepared their ambush , and then failed to protect the, many of whom ran into the river and werewith stones from the bank . Dozens ofwere taken to hospital . The remainder continued on to Derry where they were attacked once more on their way toBridge before they finally reached Guildhall Square , where they held a rally .broke out after the rally . Police droveinto the, but did not come after them . In the early hours of the following morning , 5 January , members of thecharged into St.'s Wells andRoad in the, breaking windows and beating residents . In his report on the disturbances , Lord Cameron remarked that " for such conduct among members of a disciplined and wellled force there can be no acceptable justification or excuse " and added that " its effect in and inspiring hostility towards the police wasgreat . "That afternoon over 1500residents built barricades , armed themselves with steel bars , wooden clubs and, and told the police that they would not be allowed into the area .chairman John Hume told a meeting of residents that they were to defend the area and noone was to come in . Groups of men wearingpatrolled the streets in shifts . John '' Casey , a local activist , painted " You are now entering Free Derry " in white paint on the gable wall of a house on the corner ofRoad andStreet . That corner , which was a popular venue for meetings , later became known as " Free Derry Corner " . On 7 January , thearea was extended to include the, another nationalist area on a hill overlooking the. A clandestine radio station calling itself " Radio Free Derry " began broadcasting to residents , playing rebel songs and encouraging resistance . On a small number of occasions law attempted crimes , but were dealt with by the patrols . Despite all this , the Irish Times reported that " the infrastructure of revolutionary control in the area has not been developed beyond the maintenance of patrols . " Following some acts of destruction and of violence late in the week , members of theincluding Ivan Cooper addressed residents on Friday , 10 January and called on them tothe barricades . The barricades were taken down the following morning .Over the next three months there were violent clashes , with local youths throwing stones at police . Violence came to a head on Saturday , 19 April after a planned march fromBridge to the city centre was banned . A protest in the city centre led to clashes with "" — unionists in sympathy with the anticivil rights stance of Ian Paisley . Police attempting to drive the protesters back into thewere themselves driven back to their barracks . A series of pitched battles followed , and barricades were built , often under the supervision ofDevlin , newly elected MP for Mid Ulster . Police pursuingbroke into a house in William Street and severely beat the, Samuel, his family and two friends .was brought to hospital " bleedingfrom a number of head wounds . " At midnight four hundredmen in full riot gear and carrying riot shields occupied the.of police vehicles drove through the area with .The following day , several thousand residents , led by the, withdrew to theand issued an ultimatum to the— withdraw within two hours or be driven out . With fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining , the police marched out through the's Gate , even as the residents were entering from the far side . The barricades were not maintained on this occasion , and routine patrols were not prevented .Samuelsuffered a heart attack four days after his beating . On 17 July he suffered a further heart attack and died . Thousands attended his funeral , and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annualBoys ' parade , scheduled for 12 August , could not take place without causing serious disturbance .TheBoys ' parade is an annual celebration by unionists of the relief of the Siege of Derry in 1689 , which began when thirteen young apprentice boys shut the city 's gates against the army of King James . At that time the parade was held on 12 August each year . Participants from across Northern Ireland and Britain marched along the city walls above the, and were often openly hostile to the residents . On 30 July 1969 the Derry Citizens Defence Association  was formed to try to preserve peace during the period of the parade , and to defend theandin the event of an attack . The chairman was , an Irish Republican Army  veteran ; the vicechairman was Paddy Doherty , a popular local man sometimes known as " Paddy" and the secretary wasWhite , another leading republican and leader of the JamesRepublican Club . Street committees were formed under the overall command of theand barricades were built on the night of 11 August . The parade took place as planned on 12 August . As it passed through Waterloo Place , on the edge of the, hostilities began between supporters and opponents of the parade . Fighting between the two groups continued for two hours , then the police joined in . They charged up William Street against the, followed by the '' . They were met with a hail of stones and petrol bombs . The ensuing battle became known as the Battle of the. Late in the evening , having been driven back repeatedly , the police firedofgas into the crowd .on the roof of a highrise block of flats onStreet threw petrol bombs down on the police .were used to maintain contact between different areas of fighting andheadquarters in Paddy Doherty 's house in Westland Street , and first aid stations were operating , staffed by doctors , nurses and volunteers . Women and girls made milkbottleof petrol bombs for supply to the youths in the front line and " Radio Free Derry " broadcast to the fighters and their families . On the third day of fighting , 14 August , the Northern Ireland Government mobilised the Ulster Special Constabulary  , a force greatly feared by nationalists in Derry and elsewhere . Before they engaged , however , British troops were deployed at the scene , carrying automatic rifles and submachine guns . Theand B withdrew , and the troops took up positions outside thearea .Athat included met senior army officers and told them that the army would not be allowed in until certain demands were met , including theof the, the disbandment of the B and the abolition of . The officers agreed that neither troops nor police would enter theanddistricts . A ' peace corps ' was formed to maintain law and order . When the British Home Secretary , Jim, visited Northern Ireland and announced his intention to visit theon 28 August , he was told that he would not be allowed to bring either police or soldiers with him .agreed .by members of the Defence Committee , he was " swept along by acrowd of thousands " upStreet and intoRoad , where he " took refuge " in a local house , and later addressed crowds from an upstairs window . In preparation for's visit the " Free Derry " wall was painted white and the " You are now entering Free Derry " sign was professionally repainted in black.Following's visit , some barricades were breached , but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform . Still the army made no move to enter the area . Law and order was maintained by a ' peace corps ' — volunteers organised by theto patrol the streets and man the barricades . There was very little crime ., in the words of , " as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from on the need for solidarity within the area . " In September the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road .The Hunt Report on the future of policing in Northern Ireland was presented to thecabinet in early October . Jimheld talks with the cabinet in Belfast on 10 October , following which the report 's recommendations were accepted and made public . They included the recommendation that theshould be ' ordinarily ' unarmed , and that the B should be phased out and replaced by a new force . The newChief Constable , Arthur Young , an, was announced , and travelled to Belfast with. The same day , announced that thewas to be dissolved . On 11 Octoberand Young visited Free Derry , and on 12 October the first military police entered the, on foot and unarmed .The Irish Republican Army  had been inactive militarily since the end of the Border Campaign in 1962 . It was low in both personnel and equipment — Chief of Staff told and Paddy Doherty in August 1969 that he " couldn 't defend the. I haven 't the men nor the guns to do it . " During the 1960s the leadership of the republican movement had moved to the left . Its focus was on class struggle and its aim was to unite the Irish nationalist and unionist working classes in order to overthrow capitalism , both British and Irish . Republicanwere formed in Northern Ireland , where was proscribed . These clubs were involved in the formation ofin 1967 . In Derry , the JamesRepublican Club worked closely with Labour Party radicals , with whom they set up the Derry Housing Action Committee and DerryAction Committee . The Derry Citizens ' Defence Association was formed initially by, who then invited other nationalists to join . Although there were tensions between the younger leaders likeWhite and the older , traditionalsuch as , both sides saw the unrest of 196869 as a chance to advance republican aims , and the two shared the platform at the Easter Rising commemoration in April 1969 .The events of August 1969 in Derry , and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes , brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the, and led to a split in December 1969 into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Initially , both armies organised for defensive purposes only , although thewere planning towards an offensive campaign . In Derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere andcommonly paid subscriptions to both . Whenwere arrested after the Official 's Easter parade in March 1970 , Officials and their trial together . At the start the Officials attracted most of the younger members . Martin McGuinness , who in August 1969 had helped defend the barricades , initially joined the Officials , but a few months later left to join the.Relations between the British Army and the residents had steadily decayed since the first appearance of troops in August 1969 . In September , after clashes between nationalist and unionist crowds that led to the death of a Protestant man , William King , the British Army erected a ' peace ring ' tothe nationalist population in the area they had previously controlled . Roads into the city centre were closed at night and people were prevented from walking on certain streets . Although some moderate nationalists accepted this as necessary , there was anger among young people .between youths and troops became more frequent . The riot following the Officials ' Easter parade in March 1970 marked the first time that the army used 'squads ' , who rushed into thewieldingto make arrests . Thesquads soon became a common feature of army arrest operations . There was also a belief that they were arresting people at random , sometimes days after the alleged offence , and based on the identification of people that they had seen from a considerable distance . Thewere condemned asby, who saw the riots as hampering attempts to resolve the situation . The Labour radicals and Official, still working together , tried to turn the youth away from rioting and create socialist organizations — one such organization was named the YoungAssociation — but to no. The, whileof riots , viewed them as the inevitable consequence of British occupation . This philosophy was more attractive to, and some of them joined the Provisional IRA . The deaths of two leadingin a premature explosion in June 1970 resulted in young militants becoming more prominent in the organization . Nevertheless , up to July 1971 the Provisional IRA remained numerically small .Two men , and Desmond Beattie , were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of 8 July 1971 . They were the first people to be killed by the British Army in Derry . In both cases the British Army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs , whileinsisted that both were unarmed . The Social Democratic and Labour Party  , the newly formed party of which John Hume and Ivan Cooper were leading members , withdrew fromin protest , but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed . The result was a surge of support for the IRA . Theheld a meeting the following Sunday at which they called on people to " join the IRA " . Following the meeting , peopleup to join , and there was largescale rioting . The British Army post at's Lane came under sustained attack , and troops there and around the city came under fire from the IRA .The increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation thatwithout trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland , and on 9 August 1971 hundreds ofand nationalists were arrested in dawn raids . In Derry , residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests , and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere ; nevertheless leading figures including andWhite were interned . In response , barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence . Unlike its predecessors , this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence , both Official and Provisional . It was defended by armed— a nogo area , one in which British security forces were unable to operate .Gun attacks on the British Army increased . Six soldiers were wounded in the first day after, and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either IRA in Derry . The army moved in in force on 18 August tothe barricades . A gun battle ensued in which a young Provisional IRA officer , , was killed . A crowd staging a sitdown protest wasdown and the protesters , including John Hume and Ivan Cooper , arrested . With barricades reappearing as quickly as they were removed , the army eventually abandoned their attempt .The Derryhad little contact with the IRA elsewhere . They had few weapons  which they used mainly for sniping . At the same time , they launched their bombing campaign in Derry . Unlike in Belfast , they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people . wrote that " the Derry, under Martin McGuinness , had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties . "Although bothoperated openly , neither was in control of Free Derry . The barricades were manned by unarmed '' . Crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the Free Derry Police , which was headed by Tony O, a Derry footballer and Northern Ireland International .An anti protest organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  atCamp in January 1972 was met with violence from the 1st Battalion , The Parachute Regiment  .had organised a march from theto Derry city centre , in defiance of a ban , on the following Sunday , 30 January 1972 . Bothwere asked , and agreed , to suspend operations on that day to ensure the march passed off peacefully . The British Army erected barricades around the Free Derry area to preventfrom reaching the city centre . On the day , march organisers turned the march away from the barriers and up to Free Derry Corner , but some youths proceeded to the barrier at William Street andsoldiers . Troops from 1then moved into Free Derry and opened fire , killing thirteen people , all of whom were subsequently found to be unarmed . A fourteenth shooting victim died four months later in June 1972 . Like the killing ofand Beattie the previous year , Bloody Sunday had the effect of hugely increasing recruitment to the IRA , even among people who previously would have been '' .Both the Provisional and Official IRA stepped up attacks after Bloody Sunday , with the tacit support of the residents . Local feelings changed , however , with the killing of Ranger William Best by the Official IRA . Best was a 19yearold local man who was home on leave from the British Army at his parents ' house in the. He was abducted , interrogated and shot . The following day 500 women marched to the Republican Club offices in protest . Nine days later , on 29 May , the Official IRA declared a ceasefire . The Provisional IRA initially stated that they would not follow suit , but after informal approaches to the British Government they announced a ceasefire from 26 June . Martin McGuinness was the Derry representative in a party of seniorwho travelled to London for talks with William, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland . The talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in Belfast when troops prevented Catholic families from taking over houses in theestate .Political pressure for the action against the " nogo " areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast . A British Army attack was considered inevitable , and the IRA took the decision not to resist it . On 31 July 1972 , Operationwas launched when thousands of British troops , equipped with armoured cars and armoured , dismantled the barricades and occupied the area .After Operation, the British Army controlled theandbylarge numbers of troops within the area , by conducting largescale ' search ' operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering , and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts . Over the following years IRA violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe ' the war was over ' in the area , although there were still frequent street riots . Nationalists — even those who did not support the IRA — remainedopposed to the army and to the state .Many of the residents ' original grievances were addressed with the passing of the Local Government  Act , 1972 , whichthe electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the singlevote .were held in May 1973 . Nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since 1923 . Since then the area has been extensively redeveloped , with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats . The Free Derry era is commemorated by the Free Derry wall , the murals of theArtists and the Museum of Free Derry . Come What  May is the second studio album by American alternative metal band Stone.

This is regarded as his most famous work . It is considered an example of unintentional fame :has noted that the type of fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to " the man who did that poster " . The work is sometimes referred to as ANew Yorker 's View of the World or A New Yorker 's View of the World because it depicts a map of the world as seen by selfabsorbed New Yorkers . At one point The New Yorker applied for a copyright from the United StatesOffice for the work . It assigned the copyright toand subsequently reproduced posters of the painting .The illustration is split in two parts , with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan 's 9th Avenue , 10th Avenue , and the Hudson River  , and the top half depicting the rest of the world . It is a westward view over 10th Avenue . The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as abounded by North American neighbors Canada and Mexico , with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing " Jersey " , the names of five cities  and three states  scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey , which is in bolder font than the rest of the country beyond the Hudson . Washington , D.C. is depicted as a remote location near Mexico .

Local artists , especially poster artists , presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions .demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban Ottawa made imitating View of the World an assignment in its graphic arts class . He also noted that the results of this assignment was a worldwide variety of globalfrom which the students viewed the world .The illustration —depicting New Yorkers ' selfimage of their place in the world , or perhaps outsiders ' view of New Yorkers ' selfimage — inspired many similar works , including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson ; that movie poster led to a lawsuit ,v.

Club gave the episode a mixed review , stating that the caseoftheweek was anof the overall themes of Veronica Mars . The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick ’ s character development , although he felt that it wasby the knowledge that the series was about to end . “ As fun as this episode is , the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it .

Founded in the early 1930s as a Conservative congregation , Beth Israel was for many decades the only synagogue in Eugene .The congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on West Eighth Street . It constructed its first building on Portland Street in 1952 , and occupied its currentfacilities in 2008 .In the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latter leaving Beth Israel , and forming the Orthodox CongregationTorah . Beth Israel came under attack from neoNazi members of thetwice , in 1994 and again in 2002 . In both cases thewere caught and convicted .Services were layled for decades .

He was followed by , who served from 1977 to 1994 , andin turn was succeeded by . Maurice Harris joinedas associate rabbi in 2003 , and served until 2011 , when he was succeeded by Boris. As of 2014 , led byand, Beth Israel had approximately 400 member households , and was the largest synagogue in Eugene .Small numbers of German Jews began settling in Eugene in the late 19th century , but most moved on . In the early 20th century the first Eastern European Jews settled there , and by the 1920s Eugene 's Jewish community began gathering prayerfor holding Friday night and Jewish holiday services in individuals ' homes . Historian Steven Lowenstein writes that " [ a ]'s death in 1933 , his home at 231 West Eighth Street was remodeled and named Temple Beth Israel " . It was a traditional Conservative synagogue , and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in Eugene .In 1952 , the congregation constructed a onestory synagogue building on an almost 1 acre  property atPortland Street . Designed by architect and Holocaustsurvivor Heinrich, the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting , and " a network of ceiling beams painted with symbols and shapes " by.Temple Beth Israel 's services and religious functions were layled for decades . Its first rabbi was Marcus Simmons . Originally from England , he was a graduate of University of London and Oxford University , and was ordained at the Hebrew . He emigrated to the United States in 1957 , and joined Beth Israel in 1959 . The members were not , however , agreed that a fulltime rabbi was required , and in 1961 , he accepted aposition in, California .Following a hiatus of two years , Louiswas hired as rabbi in 1963 . Born in New York City in 1912 to immigrant parents , he was a graduate of City University of New York and was ordained at the Jewish Institute of New York . He had previously worked for the United Jewish Appeal , and from 1959 to 1963 was the firstrabbi at Syracuse University . There was some concern about's hiring , as he had a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the AfricanAmerican Civil Rights Movement  . He served until his death in 1976 .was hired as rabbi in 1977 .in Reform Judaism , he had previously served as a rabbi in, Kansas for two years , then lived in Israel for two years , before coming to Eugene .was known for his support for minority rights and gay rights , antinuclear and antiwar activism , support of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians , and outreach to non members of Eugene 's Jewish community . attempted to revive the Biblical concept of the " " in his approach to. He was willing toat anif the nonJewish partner , after discussions with the rabbi , agreed of his or her own free will to fulfill a set of commitments , including " a commitment to a Jewish home life , participation in Jewish life and tradition , and raising future children as Jews " . The nonJewish partner making this commitment became a " " , or " nonJewish member of the Jewish people " . 's wife Alice was a strong feminist , and during the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to theand ritual . These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers , and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example , using genderneutral terms andfor God , and adding references to the Biblicalin prayers like the, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical. While most congregation members approved of these changes , a minority resisted them .By the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over a number of issues , including personal, the rabbi 's activism and " advocacy of ' ultraliberal ' causes " , political differences over the Israeli – Palestinian conflict , anda myriad of additional Jewish cultural / religious issues , such as the acceptance ofcouples , adherence todietary laws , the use of modern language and music during worship services ,of certain prayers such as theto make them less, and so on .However , the biggest source of division , whichall others , was " the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue . "In the early 1990s a group of newlymembers began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue , complete with a, a partition separating men and women . The " more feministminded " members strongly objected to having aanywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they attended . The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either thewould have to be taken down , or those members who wanted it would have to leave .also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left , renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi , creating Eugene 's second synagogue , originally called " The " , and in 1998 renamed " CongregationTorah " . held himself responsible , and the schism led to his "of the needs of Temple Beth Israel and his role as a rabbi " . As a result , he left Beth Israel in 1994 to lead a synagogue on Long Island . During his tenure at Beth Israel , membership rose from 118 to 350 families .died two years later at age 51 .succeededin 1995 .began his involvement at Temple Beth Israel first as a, then as cantor , and then as an assistant rabbi . He was active in forming the Jewishmovement , and was ordained by its leader .The congregation decided to leave the Conservative movement in 1995 , and for a year had no affiliation . In late 1996 , after considering both Reform andas, the congregation affiliated with themovement . By 1999 , membership had grown to around 370 families . was instrumental in developing the concept of " " , the idea that one should only purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way .

He is one of theof The OpenConcerning Religion and Science From American, part of the Project which " encourages andthe teaching of evolution in schools " . In 2011 , Borisjoined the congregation as its newest associate rabbi .On March 20 , 1994 , Chris Lord , an individual associated with theand American Front , fired ten rounds with an assault rifle into the temple , damaging the interior . The attacks were prompted by a newspaper article about several members of Eugene 's Jewish community , including a lesbian . Community organizations , including a local gay rights group , responded by standing vigil outside the synagogue duringservices . Lord and an associate were caught and convicted , and Lord was sentenced to four and a half years in prison .On October 25 , 2002 Jacob, his brother Gabriel, Gerald, Jesse Baker , and one other man , all members of the, drove to Beth Israel with the intent of intimidating the. While a service with 80 members attending was taking place , the men threw rocks etched with Nazithrough the synagogue 's stained glass windows , thenoff . The men were caught , pleaded guilty , and were convicted . They served sentences ranging from a 6month work release term and five years, to eleven years and three months in federal prison for the, Jacob.Originally sized for 75 families , Temple Beth Israel 's Portland Street building had been renovated and enlarged over the years to 7500 square feet  to accommodate 250 families and 150 students . Despite these additions and the loss of members to CongregationTorah , the synagogue was not large enough , particularly during the High, when extra space had to be rented . In 1997 the congregation purchased the property of the University Street Christian Church for $ 500000  , and began planning for a new facility . The members considered renovating the existing building on the property , but felt a new building would better suit their requirements , and razed the church .In 2003 the congregation got a permit to begin construction of a new facility on the nowvacant 137acre  plot of land at the northwest corner of East 29th Avenue and University Street . An initial capital campaign raised more than $ 18 million , which fully paid for the land , and by August 2007 an additional $ 17 million had been raised towards anticipated overall project costs of $ 5 million .The environmentally sensitive building was designed bySolomon and Associates of Kansas City and local companyArchitects &, and built byCommercial Construction of Eugene . The building used " energy efficient heating , ventilation and lighting " : specific design issues with the building 's energy efficiency included the fact that the largest room in the building , the sanctuary , was also the leastused , and , in accord with Jewish tradition , had to face east  .On June 8 , 2008 the congregation dedicated its new building at 1175 East 29th Avenue . At approximately 25000 square feet  , the facility included a sanctuary , commercial kitchen , banquet facilities , and classrooms , and housed the synagogue , the Lane County Jewish Federation , and the local Jewish Family Service . The project ended up costing $ 6 million , of which $ 4 million had been raised .Made of concrete , steel , and wood , the building achievedin Energy and Environmental Design compliance " through the integration ofmanagement strategies , high efficiency irrigation , the use of recycled and / ormaterials , and drought tolerant.

The building was converted for use as an educational center , while retaining some of the original architectural elements .economic conditions forced the Child Development Center to give up the building in 2011 , and Eugene 's Network Charter School planned to move into it in autumn 2011 .Harris announced he would be stepping down as rabbi in 2011 , and the synagogue hired Borisas his successor .

The route begins at an intersection with NYin the village ofand runs in a general northwest – southeast direction across Niagara and Erie counties to its east end at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Newstead , just south of the village of. NY 93 serves as a connector between several major, including NY 104 in, NY 31 just west of the city of, and NY 78 south of the city .The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . Although it began inand ended in Newstead as it does today , the initial routing of NY 93from the modern path in the vicinity of the city of. Fromto's eastern suburbs , the highway originally used NY 425 , Lower Mountain Road ,Road , and a series of streets in. NY 93 was moved onto NY 104 and Junction Road inin the 1940s , and altered to bypassto the south on a new highway and Robinson androads in 1991 . In 2006 , NY 93 was realigned west ofto continue south on Junction Road to NY 31 . The change removed NY 93 from Upper Mountain Road , a countyowned highway that had been part of the route since the 1930s .NY 93 begins at an intersection with NY in the center of the village of. The route proceeds eastward through the village as a twolane road namedStreet , serving two blocks of commercial areas beforeto the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of. At the eastern village limits , NY 93 brieflyto four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway . Past the junction , the highwayto a twolane road and changes names to–Road as it runs across the town of Porter . The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners , where NY 93 connects to NY 18  .After NY 18 , NY 93 curves to the southeast , serving another residential stretch ahead of a junction with– Wilson Road  on the eastern edge of Towers Corners . After this intersection , the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town . The route continues on a southeast track through Porter , passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center , where NY 93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road  . Another southeastward stretch brings the route acrossCreek and into the hamlet of, where NY 93 becomes the community 's main street . Through, NY 93 retains the–Road name , intersecting withRoad  in the hamlet 's business district .Just outside, NY 93 leaves the town of Porter for the town of Wilson . It continues generally southeastward across mostly open terrain , meeting Randall Road  and Church Street  on its way to the town of. NY 93 becomes North Ridge Road at the town line , and it soon enters the hamlet of North Ridge , a community built up around the route 's intersection with NY 425  . The hamlet 's residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community ofCorners , where NY 93 becomes concurrent with NY 104  . NY 93 and NY 104 proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for 2 miles  to the hamlet of Warren Corners , at which point NY 93 splits from NY 104 and heads southward along Town Line Road . It immediately intersects with Stone Road  before leaving the hamlet .Outside of Warren Corners , the route heads across rural areas along the–town line . It soon enters the small hamlet ofCorners , where the road passes under Lower Mountain Road  .to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur  , a connector leading to Lower Mountain Road . NY 93 continues southward along the town line , changing names to Junction Road at an intersection with Upper Mountain Road  west of the city of. From here , the route crosses overTransportation 's rail line at the hamlet ofJunction before intersecting with NY 31  and NY 270  just south of the community . NY 270 begins straight ahead to the south while NY 93 turns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road , beginning a concurrency with NY 31 .Now fully in the town of, NY 31 and NY 93 proceed northeast through an open area of the town as a fourlane divided highway . The two routes continue to the western edge of the city of, where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and theBypass . The overlap ends here as NY 93 turns southeastward onto the twolane bypass . Along the bypass , NY 93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects withRoad  just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal . Past the waterway , the bypass takes a morecourse through an undeveloped part of the town ofto a junction with Robinson Road  on the–town line . TheBypass ends here , leaving NY 93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road .The route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along Robinson Road ; however , it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road 's intersection with NY 78  . At this point , the–town line turns south to follow NY 78 , leaving NY 93 fully within the town ofas it runs eastward past another stretch of homes . Not far from NY 78 , NY 93 changes names toRoad at an intersection with Beattie Avenue  and Raymond Road  . The junction also marks a shift in the road 's surroundings as the homes give way to open , rolling terrain . NY 93 continues eastward for several miles to the town of, where it meetsRoad  andRoad  at adjacent intersections just east of the town line .NY 93 takes overRoad 's name and rightofway , continuing eastward past a line of scattered homes to reach the sparsely developed hamlet of. Here , the route turns southward at a junction with Bunker Hill Road  . Outside of, NY 93 heads southeastward across undeveloped areas of, connecting to Block Church Road  as it approachesCreek and the Niagara – Erie county line . The road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about 15 miles  prior to curving southward at an intersection withRoad  . The turn brings NY 93 acrossCreek and into the Erie County town of Newstead , where it becomes known as Maple Road and immediately intersects with CR 260  .Continuing southward , NY 93 runs across open , rolling terrain , meeting CR 259  on its way to the hamlet ofMills . Here , the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as NY 93 intersects with CR 255  in the center of the community . South ofMills , the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 miles  , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR 253  and CR 42  . It continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR 218  to the outskirts of the village of, where the highway turns east onto Lewis Road and soon enters the village limits . NY 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street , a road maintained by Erie County as CR 261 north of the village .The route turns south at Cedar Street , following the residential street into downtown. Here , NY 93 intersects with CR at a junction that was once the western terminus of NY 267 . At this intersection , NY 93 heads west on John Street for one block before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block to Main Street . NY 93 turns westward again , following Main Street through the westernmost part of's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction withStreet . The highway takes on theStreet name as it crosses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown. Just south of the creek , NY 93 changes names toStreet at an intersection with Jackson Street .As the route continues southward through the southern part of, it serves mostly residential areas , save for an industrial complex at NY 93 's intersection with CR 163  and CR 167  . NY 93 exitsa short distance south of the junction , at which point the route heads into another area of open fields while retaining theStreet name . It continues on a southward track for about 1 mile  to aintersection with NY 5  , whereStreet and NY 93 both come to an end .NY 93 was established as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , connecting the cities and villages of,, and. While theof NY 93 have remained the same to this day , several portions of the route have been realigned since that time . When NY 93 was first assigned , it turned south at the hamlet of North Ridge and overlapped with NY 425 along– Wilson Road to Lower Mountain Road , then part of NY 3 . NY 425 went west from this junction while NY 93 headed eastward , following NY 3 along Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , Upper Mountain , and Saunders Settlement roads to the city of. AtStreet , NY 93 left NY 3 and exited the city along, High , andstreets andRoad . It met its current alignment southeast of the city in.NY 3 was realigned c . 1932 to follow Saunders Settlement Road betweenRoad  and Upper Mountain Road . The former routing of NY 3 along, Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain roads was redesignated as NYeven though all of NY 3 's former routing was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93 . The NYdesignation was eliminated c . 1935 when NY 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central New York . In the early 1940s , NY 93 was altered to follow North Ridge Road , U.S. Route 104  , and Junction Road between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Road .Around the same time that NY 93 was rerouted , NY 270 was also extended northward along Junction Road from NY 31 to US 104 . As a result , NY 93 overlapped NY 270 between Lower Mountain Road and US 104 . The overlap with NY 270 remained in place until c . 1963 when NY 270 was truncated southward to the intersection of Lower Mountain and Junction roads . NY 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass Lower Mountain and Gothic Hill Roads on Junction and Upper Mountain roads , replacing NY 270 along Junction Road . The Lower Mountain Road portion of NY 93 's former routing is now maintained by Niagara County as County Route .TheBypass , a highway bypassing downtownto the southwest , was opened to traffic on July 26 , 1991 . The highway cost $ 77 million  to construct and extended from the junction of NY 31 and NY 93 west of the city to Robinson Road south of downtown . NY 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to Robinson Road , where it turned east and followed Robinson Road  andRoad  toRoad in. The portion ofRoad  east of thecity limits became NY, an unsigned reference route . and maintenance of Robinson Road from the bypass to NY 78 was transferred from Niagara County to the state of New York on September 1 , 1990 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . The portion of NY 93 between NY 78 andRoad became statemaintained on October 1 , 1998 , as part of another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance ofRoad to Niagara County .Road is now CR 142 .On November 1 , 2005 , the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation  to remove the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road , a countymaintained highway , andit to Junction Road  and Saunders Settlement Road  . Thefor the change came from a resident of Upper Mountain Road , who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway . This part of the agenda was passed .obliged to the request in 2006 ,NY 93 as proposed andNY 270 southward to NY 31 .

Forming on October 27 near Guam , the storm slowly intensified while moving westward .developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking Luzon on October 31 . The storm weakened over land , but reintensified over the South China Sea , reaching peak winds of 150 km / h  on November 2 off the southeast coast of China . Typhoonstalled and encountered unfavorable conditions , resulting in quick weakening . By November 3 , it had weakened to tropical storm status , and was no longer being warned on by the next day . In northern Luzon ,damaged 32000 houses , including 3000 that were destroyed , and caused four fatalities . High winds and rainfall leftmillion  in damage .On October 27 , an area of convection with a broad circulation persisted southeast of Guam , and slowly consolidated due to moderate wind shear andoutflow . That day , the Japan Meteorological Agency  classified the system as a tropical depression about 380 km  to the southeast of, Guam . At 2100 UTC on October 28 , the Philippine,and Astronomical Services Administration  began issuing advisories on the depression , giving it the local name. The next day , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center  also classified it as Tropical Depression. By that time , the storm was moving steadily westward due to the subtropical ridge to the north . With the warm waters of the Philippine Sea ,wind shear , and improving outflow ,gradually strengthened , and the JTWC also upgradedto tropical storm status on October 30 after an eye feature developed .While approaching northern Luzon on October 29 ,quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a welldefined eye .

Early the next day , the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10 minute winds of 140 km / h  . Later , increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate , andbegan slowing about 260 km  eastsoutheast of Hong Kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge . After remaining nearly stationary ,began moving steadily to the westsouthwest due to a new ridge . The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from, anddeteriorated to tropical storm status on November 3 . The next day , the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection . Also on November 4 , the JMA downgradedto tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast . The system dissipated at 0000 UTC on November 5 .Beforestruck the Philippines , PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for portions of northern Luzon , where winds were expected to reach over 100 km / h  .

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission  is anorganisation of six independent member states whose principal function is to mark , record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members who died in the two World Wars . The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II . The Commission was founded byWare and constituted through Royal Charter in 1917 named the Imperial War Graves Commission . The change to the present name took place in 1960 .The Commission , as part of its mandate , is responsible for commemorating all Commonwealth war dead individually and equally . To this end , the war dead are commemorated by name on a, at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial . War dead are commemorated uniformly and equally , irrespective of military or civil rank , race or.The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 17 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries . Since its inception , the Commission has constructed approximately 2500 warand numerous memorials . The Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23000 separate burial sites and the maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide . In addition to commemorating Commonwealth military service members , the Commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40000 nonCommonwealth war graves and over 25000 nonwar military and civilian graves . The Commission operates through the continued financial support of the member states : United Kingdom , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , India and South Africa . The current President of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is Prince Edward , Duke of Kent .On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 ,Ware , a director of the RioCompany , found that at 45 years old he was too old to join the British Army . He used the influence of Riochairman , Viscount, to become the commander of a mobile unit of the British Red Cross . He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of , General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the GravesCommission . The new GravesCommission had over 31000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50000 registered by May 1916 .When municipalbegan toWare began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further. Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and Frenchunder the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was notto leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in, and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition thatrespected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government .As reports of the grave registration work became public , the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers . By 1917 , 17000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives . In March 1915 , the Commission , with the support of the Red Cross , began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests . The GravesCommission became the Directorate of Gravesandin the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding tofrom relatives of those killed . The's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war , with units deployed in Greece , Egypt and Mesopotamia .As the war continued , Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the postwar period . Following a suggestion by the British Army , the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was appointed by the British government in January 1916 , with Edward , Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as president . The National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the Directorate of Gravesandafter the war . The government felt that it was more appropriate tothe work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department . By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves . With the help of Edward , Prince of Wales , Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted . The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter , with the Prince of Wales serving as president , Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman and Ware as vicechairman . The Commission 's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the First World War . Once land forand memorials had been guaranteed , the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin . By 1918 , some 000 graves had been identified and a further 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave .The scale , and associated high number of casualties , of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead . Previous to World War I , individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers . However , the war requiredof a significant percentage of the population , either as volunteers or through conscription . An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated , even if they were lowranking members of the military . A committee underKenyon , Director of the British Museum , presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the. Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions . Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses , it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling ofthat had developed between serving ranks .An article in The Times on 17 February 1919 byKipling carried the Commission 's proposal to a wider audience and described what the graves would look like . The article entitled War Graves : Work of Imperial Commission : Mr. Kipling 's Survey was quickly republished as an illustrated booklet , Graves of the Fallen . The illustrated booklet was intended tothe impact of Kenyon 's report as it included illustrations ofwith mature trees and shrubs ; contrasting the bleak landscapes depicted in published battlefield photos . There was an immediate publicfollowing the publication of the reports , particularly with regards to the decision to notthe bodies of the dead . The reports generated considerable discussion in the press which ultimately led to a heated debate in Parliament on 4 May 1920 . Sir Jamesstarted the debate , followed by speeches by Williamin favour of the Commission 's principles and Robert Cecil speaking for thoserepatriation and opposingof grave markers . Winston Churchill closed the debate and asked that the issue not proceed to a vote .withdrew his motion , allowing the Commission to carry out its work assured of support for its principles .Three of the most eminent architects of their day , Sir Herbert Baker , Sir Reginald, and Sir Edwinwere commissioned to design theand memorials .Kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions .In 1920 , the Commission built three experimentalat Le,and, following the principles outlined in the Kenyon report . Of these , theCommunal Cemetery andwas agreed to be the most successful . Having consulted with garden designer Gertrude Jekyll , the architects created a walled cemetery with uniformin a garden setting , augmented by's Cross ofand' Stone of Remembrance . After some adjustments ,became the template for the Commission 's building programme .were required because all three experimentalwent over budget . To ensure futureremained within their budget the Commission decided to not build shelters inthat contained less than 200 graves , to not place a Stone of Remembrance in any cemetery with less than 400 graves , and to limit the height of cemetery walls to 1 metre  .At the end of 1919 , the Commission had spent  7500 , and this figure rose to  250000 in 1920 as construction ofand memorials increased . By 1921 , the Commission had established 1000which were ready for , and burials . Between 1920 and 1923 , the Commission was shipping 4000a week to France . In many cases smallwere closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones . By 1927 , when the majority of construction had been completed , over 500had been built , with 400000, a thousand Crosses of, and 400 Stones of Remembrance .The Commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave , which amounted to 315000 in France and Belgium alone . The Commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing ; each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the Western Front . After resistance from the French committee responsible for theof memorials on French territory , the Commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials , and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existingrather than as separate structures .Reginald'sGate was the first memorial to the missing located in Europe to be completed , and was unveiled on 24 July 1927 . TheGate  was found to have insufficient space to contain all the names as originally planned and 34 names of the missing were instead inscribed on Herbert Baker 's Memorial to the Missing . Other memorials followed : the Helles Memorial in Gallipoli designed by John James; theMemorial on the Somme and theMemorial designed by Edwin; and the Basra Memorial in Iraq designed by EdwardWarren . Theand India also erected memorials on which they commemorated their missing : theMemorial for the forces of India , theMemorial by Canada , theMemorial by Australia , theWood Memorial by South Africa and the BeaumontHamel Memorial by Newfoundland . The programme of commemorating the dead of the Great War was considered essentially complete with the inauguration of theMemorial in 1932 , though theMemorial would not be finished until 1936 , theMemorial until 1938 andwere still conducting work on theGate when Germany invaded Belgium in 1940 .The only memorial created by the Commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was theInstitute at, Egypt — complete with library , andand pathology departments — as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps . Its erection was agreed with local political pressure .From the start of the Second World War in 1939 , the Commission organised grave registration units and , planning ahead based on the experience gained from the First World War , earmarked land for use as. When the war began turning in favour of the Allies , the Commission was able to begin restoring its First World Warand memorials . It also began the task of commemorating the 600000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War . In 1949 , the Commission completedCanadian War Cemetery , the first ofnewand 36 new memorials . Eventually , over 350000 newwere erected . Many were made fromWood stone . The wider scale of World War II , coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries , meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer . Following the war , the Commission implemented a fiveyearrenovation programme . Theneglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made . These , together with theof maintenance tasks from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s .With the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the World War I , Winston Churchill agreed to Ware 's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths . A supplemental chapter was added to the Imperial War Graves Commission 's charter on 7 February 1941 ,the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War , which resulted in the creation of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour . The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67000 civilians . The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended . The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956 ; the final volume was added to the showcase in 1958 .Following World War II the Commission recognised that the word ' Imperial ' within its name was no longer appropriate . In the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation 's name was changed to Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 1960 .More recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the Commission to care forin a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether .Indian Cemetery in Germany wasafter the end of World War II and until the Germanbecause it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 . The SixDay War and War ofresulted in the destruction of PortMemorial and Aden Memorial , and the death of a Commissionat Suez War Memorial Cemetery . During the Lebanese Civil War twoin Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt . The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iran – Iraq War in the 1980s , with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War .The Commission has , and continues to , also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate . In 1982 , the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission 's assistance to design and constructin the Falkland Islands for those killed during theWar . Although theseare not Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these. Since 2005 , the Commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the British Ministry of Defence forand graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War . In 2003 , Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility . As of 2011 , the Commission conducts a twelveyear cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans ' markers installed at the expense of the Government of Canada .In 2008 , anexcavation discovered mass graves on the edge ofWood outside of. Twohundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed Military Cemetery . This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years , the last suchhaving been built after the Second World War .The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 17 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II . Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a, at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial . As a result , the Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide . The vast majority of burial sites are preexisting communal or municipaland parishlocated in the United Kingdom , however the Commission has itself constructed approximately 2500 warworldwide . The Commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave ; the largest of these is theMemorial .The Commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years , while in Commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service . The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First World War and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 for the Second World War . The end date for the First World War period is the official end of the war , while for the Second World War the Commission selected a date approximately the same period afterDay as the official end of the First World War was after the 1918 Armistice . who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service . They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George 's Chapel in Westminster Abbey . In addition to its mandated duties , the Commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40000 nonCommonwealth war graves and over 25000 nonwar military and civilian graves .As well as the main Principal Architects for France and Belgium  , there were Principal Architects appointed for other regions as well . Sir Robertwas Principalfor Italy , Macedonia and Egypt , while Sir John Jameswas Principalfor Palestine and Gallipoli , assisted by Thomas Smith. The Principalfor Mesopotamia was EdwardWarren .As well as these senior architects , there was a team of Assistant Architects who were actually responsible for many of the cemetery and memorial designs . These architects were younger , and many of them had served in the war . The Assistant Architects were : GeorgeGordon,Clement von Berg , Charles Henry Holden  , William Harrison, William , George Hartley Goldsmith , Frank, Arthur James Scott Hutton , Noel Ackroyd, and John Reginald. Other architects that worked for the Commission , or won competitions for the Commission memorials , included George , Harold ,Owen Rees , Gordon H. Holt , and Henry Philipde.In January 1944 , Edwardwas appointed Principalfor the UK .worked extensively for the Commission for 25 years until 1969 , becoming Chiefand also succeeding Kenyon as Artistic. Together with, the other Principal Architects appointed during and after the Second World War were Hubert Worthington , Louis de, Philipand Colin St Clair.Leadingthat worked on the memorials andafter the First World War included Eric Henri, Charles Thomas Wheeler , Gilbert, and CharlesJagger . Other, both in the interwar period and after the Second World War , included William Reid Dick , Ernest, Basil, Alfred Turner , Laurence A. Turner , Walter Gilbert , Henry Poole , Vernon Hill , RobertBell , Ferdinand Victor, Joseph, and Gilbert.Structural design has always played an important part in the Commission 's. Apart from a few exceptions , due to local geological conditions , thefollow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world . This makes theeasily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries .A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wroughtiron gate entrance . Forin France and Belgium , a landnear the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments . All but the smallestcontain a register with an inventory of the burials , a plan of the plots and rows , and a basic history of the cemetery . The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery . More recently , in larger sites , a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign . Thewithin the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size .The cemetery grounds are , except in drier climates , grass covered with a floral border around the. There is also an absence of any paving between therows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace . However , Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks andthe nature of the war deaths .Typically ,of more than 40 graves contain a Cross ofdesigned by architect Reginald. This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found inin England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross . The cross is normally afourpoint limestone Latin cross , mounted on an octagonal base , and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet . A bronze, blade down , is embedded on the face of the cross . This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery , intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of selfsacrifice . with more than 1000 burials typically have a Stone of Remembrance , designed by Edwinwith the inscription " Their Namefor" . The concept of the Stone of Remembrance stone was developed byKipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively . In contrast to the Cross of, the design for the stone deliberately avoided " shapes associated with particular religions " . The geometry of the structure was based on studies of the. Each stone is 35 metres  long and 15 metres  high . The shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar . The feature was designed using the principle of. The subtle curves in the design , if extended , would form a sphere 1 feet 8 inches  in diameter .Every grave is marked with a. Eachcontains the national emblem or regimental badge , rank , name , unit , date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives . Theuse a standard upper casedesigned by MacDonald Gill . Individual graves are arranged , where possible , in straight rows and marked by uniform, the vast majority of which are made of Portland stone . The originaldimensions were 76 centimetres  tall , 38 cm  wide , and 76 cm  thick .Mostare inscribed with a cross , except for those deceased known to beor nonChristian . In the case of burials of Victoria Cross or George Cross recipients , the regimental badge is supplemented by the Victoria Cross or George Cross emblem . Sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement ; in such cases their primary name is shown along with the" served as " . Manyare for unidentified casualties ; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body . The, developed byKipling , that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is " A Soldier of the Great War knownGod " . Somebear the text " believed to be buried in this cemetery " when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known . In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus onecovers more than one grave . Thedoes not denote any specific details of the death except for its date , and even then only if it is known , and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death .Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to deviate from its standard design . In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes , such as Thailand and Turkey , stonefaced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking intoground . In Italywere carved from limestone because it was in more plentiful supply . InMilitary Cemetery , in Greece , to avoid risk of earthquake damage , smallare laid flat on the ground . The smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia .Commissionare distinctive in treatingas an integral part of the cemetery design . Originally , theconcept was to create an environment where visitors could experience a sense of peace in a setting , in contrast to traditionally bleak.given by Arthur William Hill , the Assistant Director of the RoyalGardens atenabled the Commission to develop cemetery layouts and architectural structures that took into account the placement of suitable plant life .structural andelements was not unfamiliar to the Commission 's architects . Sir Edwinfurthered his longstanding working relationship withGertrude Jekyll , whose devotion to traditional cottage garden plants andgreatly influenced the appearance of the. Where possible , indigenous plants were utilised to enhance sentimental associations with the gardens of home .Variety in texture , height and timing of floral display were equally important . The beds around eachare planted with a mixture of and . Lowgrowing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil fromback during rain . Inwhere there are pedestal grave markers , dwarf varieties of plants are used instead .The absence of any form of paving between therows contributes to the simplicity of the cemetery designs . Lawn paths add to the garden, and are irrigated during the dry season in countries where there is insufficient rain . Where irrigation is inappropriate or impractical , dryis an ecological alternative favoured by the Commission 's, as is the case in Iraq .areas require a different approach not only for, but also to plants and styles of planting . Similarly , there are separate in tropical climates . When manyare concentrated within a limited area , like along the Western Front or Gallipoli peninsula , mobile teams ofoperate from a local base . Elsewhere , largerhave their own dedicated staff while smallare usually tended by a singleworking parttime .The affairs of theare overseen by a Board of Commissioners .

In the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , these grants amounted to  586 million of the organisation 's  665 million of income . Thisto an approximate cost of C $ 85 per commemorated war dead . The contribution from each country is proportionate to the number of graves themaintains on behalf of that country . The percentage of total annual contributions for which each country is responsible is United Kingdom 784 % , Canada 101 % , Australia 61 % , New Zealand 21 % , South Africa 21 % and India 12 % .A project is underway to photograph the graves of and memorials to all service personnel from 1914 to the present day and make the images available to the public . The work is being carried out by The War GravesProject in conjunction with the. As of August 2013 , the project has recorded 17 million photographs for.Immediately following the First World War , the British Army remained responsible for theof remains . The Western Front was divided into sectors andfor bodies by 12manunits . Between the Armistice and September 1921 , theunits reburied 204 bodies . After 1921 , no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in February 1921 responsibility of thewas transferred to the Commission . Despite thesearches , bodies continued to be discovered in numbers . In the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38000 bodies were discovered . In the mid 1920s , 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly .The discovery of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually . For example , in 2006 eight bodies of Canadian soldiers from the 78th Battalion  ,were discovered in a backyard in, France . In April 2013 , the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with metal detector in 2009 were reinterred atCemetery near, France . In March 2014 , the remains of 20 Commonwealth and 30 German soldiers were discovered in le , France with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied atBritish Cemetery .When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains . The details are then registered and archived at the Commission 'sthe collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains ,data and DNA . The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research . Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties . In December 2013 , it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick, who was previously commemorated on theFlying Services Memorial , had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in, EastFlanders in Belgium . Sergeant Leonardwas identified in 2013 after a visitor toBritish Cemetery discovered aof an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date . , including those of war dead , are targets for vandalism . The gravestones ,and buildings of the Commission are no exception . The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the by young people , noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays .thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the Cross of, which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass .The vandalism of Commissionhas also been connected to the participation of Commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts . In the 1970s , in The Troubles , Commissionin Ireland experienced vandalism .defaced the central memorial of theMilitary Cemetery in northern France with antiBritish and antiAmerican graffiti on 20 March 2003 immediately after the beginning of the Iraq War . On 9 May 2004 , thirtythreewere demolished in the Gaza cemetery , which contains 3691 graves , allegedly in retaliation for the Abuprisoner abuse scandal . On 24 February 2012 , during theCivil War , an Islamist militia damaged over 200in thewar cemetery as well as the central memorial .or was the tenth Archbishop of Canterbury from 731 to. Prior to becoming archbishop , he was a monk and abbot of a Benedictine monastery . Besides his ecclesiastical career ,was a writer , andhe composed survive . Another work he composed was on the grammar of the Latin language , which was aimed at advanced students of that language . He was subsequently considered a saint . was aby birth . Hisat Canterbury stated that when he died he was in old age , so perhaps he was born around. He became a monk at the monastery at ontheHill in the presentday County of, and then abbot of that house . Through the influence of Kinghe was appointed as Archbishop of Canterbury in 731 and was consecrated on 10 June 731 . He was one of a number ofwho were appointed to Canterbury during theand. Apart from his consecration of the Bishops of Lindsey andin 733 ,'s period as archbishop appears to have been uneventful . He died in office on 30 July. Later considered a saint , his feast day is 30 July .Bede 's commentary oncalls him a " et ,"  . These qualities were displayed in the two surviving manuscripts of hisand four of his Ars. The Ars is one of only two surviving 8thcentury Latinfrom England , and was based on the works ofand. Thedeal with such diverse topics as philosophy and charity , the five senses and the alphabet , and a book and a pen . Theare formed in. The grammar is a reworking of's Ars Minor with the addition of information drawn from other. It was not designed for a newcomer to the Latin language , but is designed for more advanced students . It covers the eight parts of speech through illustrations drawn from classical scholars , although not directly but through otherworks . There are also some examples drawn from the. The work was completed before he became archbishop , and was used not only in England but also on the continent . A recent edition of his works isOpera, published in 1968 with some translations into English and German from the original Latin . The TypeI was a class of small coastal submarines  built in Germany at the beginning of the First World War . 20 boats were constructed , most of which went into service with the German Imperial Navy . Boats of this design were also operated by the AustroHungarian Navy  and the Bulgarian Navy . The group is sometimes known as the 1 class after SM 1 , the class leader . In the AustroHungarian Navy , it was called the U10 class .Built to meet the need for smallsubmarines able to operate in the narrow , shallow seas off Flanders , the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed , then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation . The design effort began in midAugust 1914 and by midOctober the first 15 boats were ordered from two German shipyards . The German Imperial Navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to AustriaHungary , who ordered a further three boats in April 1915 . A total of 20Is were built . Construction of the first boats for Germany began in early November 1914 ; all 20 were completed by October 1915 . Several of the first boats underwent trials in German home waters , but the rest were assembled and tested at either Antwerp or Pola . The German boats operated primarily in the Flanders , Baltic , and Constantinople. The boats were about 28 metres  long and displaced 127 tonnes  when surfaced and 142 tonnes  while submerged . All had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes , and were equipped with a deckmounted machine gun .In 1918 four of the surviving German boats were converted into coastal. Of the seventeen boats in German service , two were sold to AustriaHungary , one was sold to Bulgaria , and nine were lost during the war . One of the five AustroHungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired . The five surviving German boats , the four surviving AustroHungarian boats , and the Bulgarian boat were all turned over to the Allies after the end of the war and were broken up .In the earliest stages of the First World War the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . By 18 August 1914 , two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium , the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun .The German Imperial Navy stipulated that the submarines must beby rail , which imposed a maximum diameter of 315 metres  . The rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name " Project 34 " — resulted in the TypeI design , created specifically for operation from Flanders . The boats were to be about 28 metres  long and to displace about 125 tonnes  with two bow torpedo tubes .Boats of the TypeI design were built by two manufacturers , Germaniawerft of Kiel and AGof, which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards . The eight Germaniawerftbuilt boats were slightly longer at 2810 metres  length overall , while the twelve built boats came in 22 centimetres  shorter than their counterparts . All were 315 metres  abeam and had a draft of 303 metres  . The boats all displaced 127 tonnes  while surfaced , but differed slightly in displacement submerged . The slightly longer Germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes  while submerged , as they weighed 1 more than theboats .Theof the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a or diesel engine on the surface , or aelectric motor for underwater travel . Theboats were capable of nearly 75 knots  on the surface and a little more than 6 knots  submerged . The Germaniawerft boats were about 1 knot  slower than their made counterparts . The boats were equipped with two 45  bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes . They were also armed with a single 8millimetre  machine gun affixed to the deck .The German Imperial Navy ordered its first fifteen TypeI boats on 15 October 1914 . Eight boats — numbered 1 to 8 — were ordered from Germaniawerft of Kiel , and seven boats — numbered 9 to U15 — from AGof. After two of the class , 1 and 15 , were sold in February 1915 to ally AustriaHungary  , the German Imperial Navy ordered 16 and 17 from. A further three for AustriaHungary — U15 , U16 , and U17 — had been ordered fromby April , bringing the total number constructed to 20 .1 and 2 were laid down on 1 November 1914 at the Germaniawerft yard at Kiel . 1 was launched on 22 January 1915 , just 75 working days later . 2 's launch followed on 13 February . Among theboats , 9 was laid down first , on 6 November 1914 , and launched on 6 February 1915 , a week ahead of 2 . These first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters , but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point .The process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway. TypeI boats destined for service with the Flanders Flotilla made a fiveday journey to Antwerp for theto threeweek assembly process . After assembly at Antwerp the boats were towed by barge to Bruges for trials . Boats selected for service in the Mediterranean were sent to the AustroHungarian port of Pola for assembly . The total time from departure of thefrom the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks .By July 1915 all seventeen of the German Imperial Navy TypeIs had been completed .During their trials the TypeIs were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being; one commander compared his TypeI to a "machine " . According to authors R. H. Gibson and Mauricein their 1931 book The GermanWar , 1914 – 1918 , thedid not have enough power to chase downwhile surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater , exhausting their batteries after little over an hour 's running . Inservice use revealed another problem : with a single propeller shaft / engine combination , if either component failed , the Uboat was almost totally disabled .Another reported problem with the TypeIs was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes . The boats were equipped withtanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the C / 06 torpedo 's 1700pound  weight , but this system did not always function properly ; as a result , when firing fromdepth the boat couldafter firing or , if too much weight was taken on ,to the depths . When 15 torpedoed and sank Italian submarinein June 1915 , the tank failed to properly compensate , forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance .Despite the problems , the " tin" , as the Germans referred to them , were in active service from March 1915 through the end of the war , with half of the 20 boats lost during the war . Boats of the class served in three navies : the German Imperial Navy , the AustroHungarian Navy , and the Bulgarian Navy . In German service , they served primarily in the Flanders Flotilla , the Baltic Flotilla , and the Constantinople Flotilla .The first TypeI to enter service was 10 , which formed the nucleus of the Flanders Flotilla , on 27 March 1915 . By the end of April five more TypeI boats had become operational . 10 was eventually joined in the Flanders Flotilla by 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 12 , 13 , 16 , and 17 ; of these , only 2 made the journey to Flanders by sea rather than rail .4 departed on the first patrol from Flanders on 9 April , and was responsible for sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla . The TypeI boats of the Flanders Flotilla originally patrolled the area between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , but began patrolling the English Channel after 6 pioneered a route past Britishnets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June .Over the TypeIs ' first year of service , 4 and 13 were both lost , and 2 and 5 were transferred to the Baltic Flotilla . In March 1917 , 6 ran aground in Dutch waters and was interned for the rest of the war , along with her crew . The four remaining TypeIs in Flanders — 10 , 12 , 16 , 17 — were all converted toby 1918 , having their torpedo tubes removed and replaced with chutes to carry up to eight mines . All but 10 were lost in 1918 ; 10 , in poor repair and out of service , was scuttled in October 1918 when the Germans evacuated from Flanders .9 was initially assigned to the Baltic Flotilla , and was joined by 2 and 5 in early 1916 . All three became training boats at Kiel in 1916 , joining 11 in that duty . Little information is available about the TypeI boats operating in the Baltic .Four of the German Imperial Navy boats — 3 , 7 , 8 , and 14 — were selected for service with the Constantinople Flotilla . All were sent to Pola for assembly and trials there as part of the Pola Flotilla before sailing on to join the Constantinople Flotilla . 3 disappeared en route to Constantinople in May 1915 , but the other three arrived there by midJune .The three TypeI boats of the Constantinople Flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in the Black Sea . 8 was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in May 1916 , and 7 disappeared in the Black Sea in October 1916 , leaving 14 as the sole remaining German TypeI in the flotilla ; she was surrendered at Sevastopol in November 1918 to French armies stationed there during the Russian Civil War .1 and the still incomplete 15 were sold to the AustriaHungary in February 1915 ; both were dismantled and shipped to Pola in May . After one cruise under the German flag , each boat was commissioned into the AustroHungarian Navy . The pair — renamed U10 and U11 , respectively — were joined by U15 , U16 , and U17 in October . Known as the U10 or the class as a part of the AustroHungarian Navy , the five boats operated primarily in the Adriatic in patrols off Italy and. U10  hit a mine in July 1918 and was, but had not been repaired by the end of the war . U16 was sunk after she torpedoed an Italian destroyer in October 1916 , and the remaining three  were ceded to Italy at the end of the war .After 8 was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in May 1916 , she was renamedNo. 18  . She was Bulgaria 's first submarine , and was engaged primarily in coastal defense duties off Bulgaria 's main Black Sea port of.No. 18 survived the war and was ceded to France after the Treaty of surSeine .20 TypeI submarines were built , 17 for the German Imperial Navy and three for the AustroHungarian Navy . Two of the German submarines — 1 and 15 — were sold to AustriaHungary and commissioned into the AustroHungarian Navy as U10 and U11 , respectively . Those two and a further three built by AGcomprised the virtually identical U10 class for the AustroHungarian Navy . Another of the German submarines , 8 , was sold to Bulgaria in May 1916 , becomingNo. 18 .SM 1 SM 2SM 3SM 4SM 5SM 6SM 7SM 8 SM 9SM 10SM 11SM 12SM 13SM 14SM 15 SM 16SM 17In the AustroHungarian Navy the TypeI boats were known as the U10 class , which consisted of two former German TypeI boats and three built specifically for AustriaHungary .SM U10 SM U11 SM U15 SM U16 SM U17 In addition , four of the German TypeIs assigned to the Pola Flotilla based at the AustroHungarian Navy 's main naval base at Pola were assigned AustroHungarian designations .SM 3 SM 7 SM 8 SM 14 These four boats remained under commission in the German Imperial Navy , retained German crews and commanders , and received orders from the German flotilla commander at Pola .Germany and Bulgaria negotiated the purchase of twoI boats for the Bulgarian Navy , 7 and 8 , in 1916 . Two crews of Bulgarian sailors were sent to Kiel for training . Before the purchase could be completed , 7 was sunk , leaving only one boat for Bulgaria . On 25 May 1916 , 8 was officially transferred to Bulgaria for the remainder of the war . No. 18 Key The military history of Gibraltar during World War II exemplifies Gibraltar 's position as a British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy , both as a foothold on the continent of Europe , and as aof British sea power . During World War II , Gibraltar served a vital role in both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean Theatre , controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean .In addition to its commanding position , Gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean . Force H , under the command of ViceAdmiral Jameswas based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of Malta . During the course of the war , Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment fromFrench aircraft and from aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force  based on Sardinia . Additionally , the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy  commandounit  and their human torpedoes . This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship SSin the nearby Spanish harbour of. A number of attacks were also carried out by Spanish andagents acting on behalf of the German.Inside the Rock of Gibraltar itself , miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone .of rock were blasted out to build an " underground city " . In huge manmade, barracks , offices , and a fully equipped hospital were constructed , complete with an operating theatre and Xray equipment .Operation, the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942 , was coordinated from the " Rock " . General Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was given command of the operation , set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation . Following the successful completion of the North African campaign and the surrender of Italy in 1943 , Gibraltar 's role shifted from a forward operating base to a reararea supply position . The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the Mediterranean until VE Day in 1945 .World War II dramatically changed the lives of. The decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most had nowhere to call ' home ' . Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being ' British ' by sharing in the war effort .In early June 1940 , about 13500were shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco . However , following the capitulation of the French to the German armies later in June 1940 , the new ProGerman FrenchGovernment found the presence of in Casablanca an embarrassment and sought opportunities for their removal . The opportunity soon arose when 15 British cargo vessels arrived under Commodore,15000 French servicemen who had been rescued from. Once their own rescued servicemen had disembarked , the ships were interned until they agreed to take away all the. Althoughwas unable to obtain permission to clean andhis ships  , when he saw the mass of civilians pouring through the dockyards , he opened up hisfor boarding . Just beforehand , the British fleet had destroyed a number of French warships atel in order to prevent them ending up in German hands . The attack , during which 1 French sailors died , led to high tensions , which were evident when families were forced at bayonet point by French troops to board taking only what they could carry , leaving many possessions behind . However , when they arrived at Gibraltar , the Governor would not allow them to land , fearing that once thewere back on the Rock , it would be virtually impossible to evacuate them a second time .gathered in JohnSquare in the centre of Gibraltar as the news broke , speeches were made and two Cityaccompanied by the Acting President of the Exchange and Commercial Library went to see the Governor  to ask that thebe allowed to land . After receiving instructions from London , a landing was allowed as long as thereturned when other ships arrived to take them away from the Rock , and by 13 July the reevacuation back to Gibraltar had been completed .British conservative politician Oliver Stanley agreed to accept thein the United Kingdom , but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved . The Governor , he declared , had given the number offirst as 13000 , then as 14000 and finally as 16000 . He asked for the situation to be clarified , stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13000 could be accepted , 2000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira . The situation , replied Generalon 19 July , " is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22000 . The 13000 was the number sent to Morocco , and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered . " In London thewere placed in the hands of the Ministry of Health , and many were housed in Kensington area . Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified , coupled with the arrival ofletters , describing the circumstances in which thewere living .In September rumours were already circulating among the, and in Gibraltar , that the possibility of reevacuating theonce more was being, this time the destination being Jamaica , in the West Indies . After much contention , it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island , and 1left for Jamaica direct , on 9 October , with more following later on . Howeverfollowed and the demands were met , partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping . The situation at the end of 1940 , therefore , was that approximately 2000were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira , with the bulk of around 10000 housed in the London area .Construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1550 yards  . The landcommenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an RAF camp at the " North Front " , now RAF Gibraltar . The RAF dispatched their next squadron to Gibraltar at this time and it was in September 1939 that war with Germany was declared and the strong possibility of German submarines concentrating in the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish port facilities ,large in Admiralty thinking . So at 09 : 00  on the 9 September 1939 , No. 202 Squadron RAF was ordered to Gibraltar , loaded to thewith equipment .On 25 September 1939 , No 200  Group was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of No 202. The Group 's function was the control of Royal Air Force units operating from Gibraltar . In late 1940 the Group was transferred to Coastal Command . Later a combined HQ was formed which commenced operations in early 1942 .On 18 July 1940 , after the attack on the French Fleet at el by the British , thegovernment authorized a bombing raid of Gibraltar as a response . Little damage was reported to have been done .On Tuesday , 24 September , the Italian Stefani news agency reported : " As a reprisal for the bombardment ofyesterday morning , onehundredandtwenty French aircraft based in Morocco attacked Gibraltar . " On the same day , the United Press Agency reported : " The French government has issued an official denial of reports , according to which French aircraft were said to have attacked Gibraltar . Up until now , nohave been undertaken . " But the United Press report ended on an ominous note with : " Frenchare imminent . "Again , on the same day , theFrench government issued orders for the naval base and city of Gibraltar to be bombarded . As a result , six bomber squadrons of theFrench Air Force  and four squadrons of theFrench Navy  were employed in the operation . The 64 bombers flew from bases in, ,,, and Port . The French action was approved by both the German Armistice Commission and the Italian Armistice Commission .No British aircraft were encountered and much damage was done in the area south of the fortress . The South Mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged . In the northern part of Gibraltar , fires broke out .On 25 September , the French returned with a larger force of eightythree bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations . Again , aircraft of the British Royal Air Force made no appearance . However , the French crews did report encountering heavy antiaircraft fire . One451 bomber was lost and 13 other aircraft were lightly damaged during the two days of bombing attacks . The British armed trawlerStella Sirius was sunk by bombs .The air attack on 25 September was the last byforces on Gibraltar .The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but , given its strategic importance , Germany made plans to capture Gibraltar ." Felix " , the plan which was signed by Adolf Hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command . With or without permission , Germany would take entry through Spain and attack Gibraltar driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean . The Strait would be effectively closed to the Allies once Gibraltar was in German hands , forcing Asiabound Allied shipping to steam all the way around Africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal . The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterward at Spanish air bases . To deny a possible Spanish capture of the base , the German planners decided that the final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone . failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the Wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940 .General Ludwig'sCorps would conduct the actual attack on the Rock . The assault forces would comprise the Infantry Regiment, theRegiment of the 1st Mountain Division , 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions , three observation battalions , three engineer battalions , two smoke battalions , a detachment of 150, and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles  , packed with high explosives .As part of a combinedforce operation , the German Air Force  would contribute Ju,,, three light AA battalions , and three heavy AA battalions . Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine would cooperate by using Uboats to interfere with British naval movement andcoastal batteries to further discourage the Royal Navy .On 10 March 1941 , with Operation Barbarossa looming , Felix was amended to Operation FelixHeinrich , whereby German troops would be withdrawn from the USSR to capture Gibraltar . As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco 's, the operation was postponed , modified , and ultimately abandoned .From Sardinia , Italian bombers attacked Gibraltar several times , mainly in 1942 . The last raids on Gibraltar were done during the 1943 Allied landing in Algeria , when those bombers hit successfully even theport .The only unit of the Regia ever to fly the was the "LongRangeSquadron " . This unit was formed in May 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines . The training of the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only in June 1942 thebecame operational . The most spectacular raids with the P. 108 bombers were flown in October 1942 when several night attacks against Gibraltar were undertaken from Sardinia .After the armistice of , the Germanallied Italian Social Republic launched at least two raids on Gibraltar : one on the night of 4 – 5 June 1944 with tenaircraft and another on 6 June with nine aircraft . Both sorties were undertaken by the "–" .Known as the " Horse of Gibraltar " ,, an Italian commandounit created during thegovernment , engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at Gibraltar .Gibraltar was a very tempting target for the Italians , who saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping . The Italianoriginally used a Spanish villa  located two miles  from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named . Their base was shifted later to the ItalianSS, interned in.Lesser known than the Italian actions were the sabotage operations and mine attacks carried out by Spanish andagents recruited in thede Gibraltar by the Germans . Thecontacted a Spanish staff officer fromde Gibraltar , Lieutenant Colonel, a Spanish officer , member of theand coordinator of the intelligence operations in the, to establish a network ofwith access to Gibraltar . designated Emilio , also a member of, as operations chief of the organisation . Most of the recruits for the sabotage operations were Spaniards from the. A combination of financial reward , ideological commitment and some threats andwere used to gather a significant number of agents . According to the British intelligence , there were at least 183 Spaniards andinvolved in the espionage and sabotage operations against Gibraltar . operations were ordered from Berlin in the late autumn of 1940 , but actual work did not start until early 1941 . The first operations were unsuccessful . A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was, as the timing device was faulty . In February there was a large explosion in the North Tunnel , and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield . In June 1941 , however , the British intelligencea new attempt , by a German agent , to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship . Another attempt failed whenplaced a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive . It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed . In January 1942 , two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip . , trained and equipped by the Germans , thesank the armed trawlerErin , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper , which resulted in the deaths of six Britishon 18 January 1942 .was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of , Manuel Romero Hume , who allowed him to beach athere . The British intelligence was able however to counteract the sabotage operations . In March 1942 , a, José Key , one of the most prominent agents working for the Germans , responsible for the collection of information on military movements for thewas arrested and executed inPrison in late 1942 . By September 1942 ,, whose activities were closely monitored by the British at that time , resigned and left Carlos, his second in command , in charge of the operations . In late 1942 , the German headquarters in Berlin ordered the sabotage operations being expanded . In early 1943 , the arrival of an experienced head ofoperations in Spain improved the outreach of the operations .In March 1943 an ammunition dump was blown up by's agents . The British , growing suspicious of some of the, banned them from entering Gibraltar . This forced theto askfor new personnel . Aworking on the Rock , José Martín, was responsible for the explosion and fire at a large fuel tank atIsland on 30 June 1943 ; this mission , however , would be the first and the last for, because he was cornered and arrested by British authorities in August , when he tried to smuggle a bomb into a weapons magazine insideStaff Cave . After being sentenced to death , he was hanged on 11 January 1944 in Gibraltar by British executioner Albert. A member of an unrelatedsabotage network , Luis López was executed byon the same day .himself was put under arrest by the Spanish police and. He would be a free man again in December , when he rejoined thein Madrid , under direct orders of Wolfgang, , head of the sabotage section in Spain . After aattempt against the life of proallied General José Enrique,by network 's agent Juan Joséand a meeting between Anthony Eden and the Spanish ambassador at London ,FitzJames Stuart ,activities around Gibraltar came to an end .Operationwas a topsecret British staybehindmission that was only to be implemented if Gibraltar was captured by the Axis Powers . Six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year . The volunteers — two doctors , threeand their leader — would run an observation post with one 12inch  by 6inch  slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the Mediterranean . The team would then wire back all shipping movements to the British Admiralty .They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the brick floor . Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released .As the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941 , an idea for a series of secret observation posts  was put together under Operation.Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffreyand his chief engineer Colonel Fordham . The site chosen at Lord's Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existingscheme for a shelter . Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard GambierParry . Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task . A member of Scott ’ s ill expedition to the Antarctic , George Murraywas called up as SurgeonCommander to advise on survival techniques . There were practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and clothing to consider as well as vital " psychology of the personnel " . The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation . A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars . However , Operationwas never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front .The operation had beenin mystery until the discovery of papers at the Public Record Office inUK . Previously in the 1960s , details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as " Operation Monkey " , yet facts were very sparse .In 1997 " Stay Behind Cave "  was discovered in Gibraltar by the GibraltarGroup , but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission . The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel . Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years .In November 2006 Jimand Sergeant Major Pete Jackson , senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , met possibly the only member of Operationstill alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England . Cooper , 92 at the time , provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a SurgeonLieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve  . He recalled stories about his colleagues , his training , and his feelings about the task .The Mediterranean Uboat Campaign lasted approximately from 21 September 1941 to May 1944 . The Kriegsmarine tried to isolate Gibraltar , Malta , and Suez and disrupt Britain 's trade routes . More than sixty Uboats were sent toAllied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea . Many of these Uboats were themselves attacked negotiating the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by Britain . Nine Uboats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged .Plans for the Allied counter offensive after the attack on Pearl Harbor were ongoing by mid1942 . An invasion of Europe in 1943 would be, but the allies could attack the " softof Europe " through the Mediterranean , as Prime Minister Winston Churchill put it .by President Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill and code named Operation, the plan was to occupy French North Africa : Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia . From these French colonies , attacks could be launched that would drive Italy out of the war .In July 1942 , Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed Allied CommanderinChief of Operation. Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this , the first largescale AngloAmerican operation of the war . He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take over , not just command of Operationitself , but also military command of Gibraltar .General Eisenhower stayed at The, the official Governor 's residence , but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the Rock . In his memoirs General Eisenhower wrote :The subterranean passages under the Rock provided the sole available office space , and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces . The eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced byelectric bulbs ., cold air in blocklong passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to theefforts of electric fans . Through the arched ceilings came a constant,,of surface water that faithfully but off the seconds of the, almost, wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins .One hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transportson Gibraltar . More than 400 aircraft of all types wereinto the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway . Fighters had been shipped inand assembled on the airfield . Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition , fuel , and other essential supplies . 168 American pilots were housed in the RAFat North Front .On 8 November 1942 ,aircraft from Gibraltar landed on captured North African airfields .From their headquarters in Gibraltar , General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham directed Operation, the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces .Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it , the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar . This " town " inside the Rock contained its own power station , water supply , and hospital . Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end . Two Canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with diamondtipped drills and 5 British engineer companies , added some 30 miles  of such tunnels , a feat thought impossible at the time . That was enough to hold all 30000 troops on the rock . Today , the rock has more underground tunnels than roads .On 4 July 1943 , a Liberator bomber from RAF Transport Command took off from Gibraltar for England . On board was General Władysław, Prime Minister of Poland 's Londonbased government in exile and CommanderinChief of its armed forces , returning from visiting Polish troops in the Middle East .The aircraft climbed normally from the runway , levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour . The 62yearold general died , along with 15 others . The sole survivor was the Czechborn pilot , Eduard, who was rescued by an RAF launch . The bodies of five passengers and crew , including's daughter , were never found .The coffins of Generaland his ChiefofStaff , General, were draped in the Polish National Flag and lay in state in the Cathedral of St. Mary the. After aMass , the bodies were carried in procession to theDockyard with full Military Honours to be shipped to London in anticipation that General's remains would one day be returned to a liberated Poland . The route to the dockyard was lined by British troops and the coffins carried and escorted by Polish.In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of's Liberator II, but was unable to determine the probable cause , finding only that it was an accident and the " aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established " . A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading toaircraft controls . Despite this finding , the political context of the event , coupled with a variety of curious circumstances , immediately gave rise to speculation that's death had been no accident , and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet , British or even Polish conspiracy .The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of theto the Rock . As a result , aBoard was established in November , and at a meeting of the Board on 8 February 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed . On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1367arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May , the first repatriation party left Madeira , and by the end of 1944 only 520 nonpriorityremained on the island .In London , home were making claims on the’ wartime accommodation and 500were reevacuated to Scotland and 3000 to camps in Northern Ireland . Although the Governor , Lt. General Sir Noel MasonMacFarlane , foughton behalf of theand did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays . As late as 1947 there were still 2000 in Northern Irish camps . The last of thedid not see the Rock again until 1951 .Military history of the British Commonwealth in the Second World War was Roman Emperor from 96 to 98 .became Emperor at the age of sixtyfive , after a lifetime of imperial service underand the rulers of thedynasty . Under, he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing theconspiracy of 65 . Later , as a loyalist to the, he attainedin 71 and 90 during theofandrespectively .On 18 September 96 ,was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of theGuard and several of his freedmen . On the same day ,was declared emperor by the Roman Senate . This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor . As the new ruler of the Roman Empire , he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during thegovernment of. 's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army . A revolt by theGuard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir . After some adopted Trajan , a young and popular general , as his successor . After barely fifteen months in office ,died of natural causes on 27 January 98 . Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan .Although much of his life remains obscure ,was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians .'s greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death , thus founding the–dynasty .Marcus was born in the village of, 50 kilometers north of Rome , to the family of Marcus ,Consul in 40 , and . Ancient sources report the date as either 30 or 35 . He had at least one attested sister , named, who married Lucius, the brother of the future Emperor.Like, the founder of thedynasty ,was a member of the Italian nobility rather than one of the elite of Rome . Nevertheless , thewere among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late Republic and early Empire , attainingin each successive generation . The direct ancestors ofon his father 's side , all named Marcus , were associated with imperial circles since the time of Emperor Augustus  .His greatgrandfather was Consul in 36 BC  , and Governor of Asia in the same year . His grandfather became Consulin July of either 21 or 22 , and was known as a personal friend of Emperor , accompanying the emperor during his voluntary seclusion on Capri from 23 onwards , dying in 33 .'s father , finally , attained thein 40 under emperor . Thewere connected with the Julio dynasty through the marriage of 's brother , and , the greatgranddaughter of.Not much of's early life or career is recorded , but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career . He was elect in the year 65 and , like his ancestors , moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist . As an advisor to Emperor, he successfully helped detect and expose theconspiracy of 65 .what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable , since they earned him rewards equal to those of's guard prefect. He receivedhonors — which was usually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace .According to the contemporary poet Martial ,also held's literary abilities in high esteem ,him as the "of our time " . Another prominent member of's entourage was, an old and respected general who had celebrated militaryduring the 40s . It appearsbefriendedduring his time as an imperial advisor , and may have asked him to watch over's youngest sonwhendeparted for the Jewish war in 67 .The suicide ofon 9 June 68 brought the Julio dynasty to an end , leading to the chaotic Year of the Four, which saw the successive rise and fall of the emperors,and, until the accession ofon 21 December 69 .nothing is known of's whereabouts during 69 , but despite the fact thatwas his brotherinlaw , he appears to have been one of the earliest and strongest supporters of the.For services unknown , he was rewarded with aearly in's reign in 71 . This was a remarkable honour , not only because he held this office early under the new regime , but also because it was an ordinary , making him one of the few non to be honoured in this way under. After 71again disappears from historical record , presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under and his sons Titus  and .He reemerges during the revolt ofin 89 . On 1 January , 89 , the governor ofSuperior , Lucius Antonius, and his twoat,XIVand,against the Roman Empire with the aid of a tribe of the. The governor of , , moved to the region at once , assisted by theof, Titus . Within twentyfour days the rebellion was crushed , and its leaders at punished . The were sent to the front of, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded . opened the year following the revolt by sharing thewith. Again , the honour suggestedhad played a part in uncovering the conspiracy , perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during theconspiracy under. Alternatively ,may have selectedas his colleague to emphasise the stability and status of the regime . The revolt had been suppressed , and the Empire could return to order .On 18 September , 96 ,was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials . The , theCalendar , records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus emperor . Despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice .was old and, and had spent much of his career out of the public light , prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in's assassination .According to , the conspirators approachedas a potential successor prior to the assassination , which indicates that he was at least aware of the plot .by contrast does not mention, but he may have omitted his role out of. Considering the works ofwere published under's direct descendants Trajan and, it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder . On the other hand ,lacked widespread support in the Empire , and as a knownloyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators . The precise facts have been obscured by history , but modern historians believewas proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , within hours after the news of the assassination broke .Although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health ,was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and. Furthermore , he had close connections with thedynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate .had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of; he knew that toeven for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict . Rather than decline the invitation and risk, he accepted . The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war , but neither the Senate norappears to have been involved in the conspiracy against.Following the accession ofas emperor , the Senate passed on: his coins and statues were melted , his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records . In many instances , existing portraits of, such as those found on the , were simplyto fit the likeness of. This allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material . In addition , the vast palace whichhad erected on theHill , known as thePalace , was renamed the " House of the People " , andhimself took up residence in's former villa in the Gardens of.The change of government was welcome particularly to the, who had been harshly persecuted during's reign . As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters ,publiclythat nowould be put to death as long as he remained in office . He called an end to trials based on treason , released those who had been imprisoned under these charges , and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled .All properties which had been confiscated bywere returned to their respective families .also sought to involve the Senate in his government , but this was not entirely successful . He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted , and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro faction of the Senate , he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life .Having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate ,had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace . As was custom by this time , a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army . Accordingly , aof 75per head was bestowed upon the citizens , while the soldiers of theGuard received awhich may have amounted to as much as 5000per person . This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the mostRomans .To the poorest ,grantedof land worth up to 60 million. Heparents and their children from a 5 % inheritance tax , and he made loans to Italian landowners on the condition that they pay interest of 5 % to their municipality to support the children offamilies ;schemes which were later expanded by Trajan ,Pius , and Marcus Aurelius . Furthermore , numerous taxes wereand privileges granted to Roman provinces ., he probably abolished the , the additional tax which all Jews throughout the Empire had to pay : some of his coins bear the legend  .Before long ,'s expenses strained the economy of Rome and , although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by, necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce. The most superfluous religious sacrifices , games and horse races were abolished , while new income was generated from's former possessions , including theof ships , estates , and even furniture . Large amounts of money were obtained from's silver and gold statues , andforbade that similar images be made in his honor .Because he reigned only briefly ,'s public works were few , instead completing projects which had been initiated underrule . This included extensive repairs to the Roman road system and the expansion of the. The latter program was headed by the former consulJulius, who helped to put an end to abuses and later published a significant work on Rome 's water supply , De. The only major landmarks constructed underwere a, known as the , and a small Imperialbegun by, which linked theof Augustus to the Temple of Peace . Little remains , partly because the Viacuts across it .Despite's measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people , support forremained strong in the army , which had called for hisimmediately after the assassination . In an attempt to appease the soldiers of theGuard ,had dismissed their prefect Titus — one of the chief conspirators against— and replaced him with a former commander , .Likewise , the generousbestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change . Theconsidered these measures insufficient , however , and demanded the execution of's assassins , whichrefused . Continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to thecrisis of's reign .While the swift transfer of power following's death had prevented a civil war from,'s position as an emperor soon proved too vulnerable , and his benign nature turned into a reluctance to assert his authority . Upon his accession , he had ordered a halt to treason trials , but at the same time allowed the prosecution ofby the Senate to continue . This measure led to chaos , as everyone acted in his own interests while trying to settle scores with personal enemies , leading the consulto famously remark that'swas ultimatelyto's anarchy . Early in 97 , a conspiracy led by the senator failed , but once againrefused to put the conspirators to death , much to the disapproval of the Senate .The situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor , made more pressing because of's old age and sickness . He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives , who were unsuited for political office . A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that , by 97 ,was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius, the powerful governor of Syria . This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus , commonly known as Trajan , a general of the armies at the German frontier .In October 97 these tensions came to a head when theGuard , led by , laid siege to the Imperial Palace and tookhostage . He was forced to submit to their demands , agreeing to hand over those responsible for's death and even giving a speechthe rebellious. Titus and,'s former, were sought out and killed .was unharmed in this assault , but his authority was damaged beyond repair .He realized that his position was no longerwithout the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people . Shortly thereafter , he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor , and with this decision all but abdicated . Trajan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared thewithin 98 :Contrary to the view here popularized by , however ,had in fact little choice with regard to his successor . Faced with a major crisis , he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation . The only candidate with sufficient military experience ,ancestry , and connections was Trajan . Likewise , Edward's assertion that established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Goodhas found little support among modern historians .On 1 January , 98 , at the start of his fourth,suffered a stroke during a private audience . Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of, on 28 January . He was deified by the Senate , and his ashes were laid to rest in theof Augustus . was succeeded without incident by his adopted son Trajan , who was greeted by the Roman populace with much enthusiasm . According to Pliny the Younger , Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of, yet no trace of it has ever been found ; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the issued until ten years after his death . According to , however , the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against, , was ' dismissed ' upon Trajan 's accession .Due to the lack of written sources on this period , much of's life has remained obscure . The most substantial surviving account of the reign ofwas written by the 3rdcentury historian . His Roman History , which spans nearly a millennium , from the arrival ofin Italy until the year, was composed more than one hundred years afterhad died . Further details are added by an abridged biography from thede, a work alleged to have been authored by the 4thcentury historian Aurelius Victor .A more comprehensive text , presumed to describe the life ofin closer detail , is the, by the contemporary historian. Theis an account of the history of Rome covering three decades from the suicide of emperorin 69 until the death ofin 96 . Unfortunately , a substantial part of the work has been lost , with only the first five books covering the Year of the Fourremaining . In the introduction to his biography ofJuliushowever ,speaks highly of, describing his reign as " the dawn of a most happy age , [ when ]Caesar blended things once, sovereignty and freedom " .The surviving histories speak equally positively of's brief reign , although none offer a substantial commentary on his policies . Both and Aurelius Victor emphasize his wisdom and, withcommending his decision to adopt Trajan as his heir . These views were later popularized by the 18thcentury historian Edwardin his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire .consideredthe first of the Five Good, five successive rulers under whom the Roman Empire " was governed by absolute power , under the guidance of wisdom and virtue " from 96 until 180 . Nevertheless , evennotes that , compared to his successors ,may have lacked the necessary qualifications for a successful reign :Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment , characterizingas a well but weak andruler . The Roman Senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule , but'sof the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a significant crisis . The mutiny led by was never intended as a coup , but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor . The adoption of Trajan expanded his power base with a respected , reliable general as his successor .concludes that's real talents were in fact illsuited to the:His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary , if tumultuous stopgap before thedynasties . It is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign , theof, ultimately became known as the , or transitional forum .Two modern statues which commemoratecan be found in towns associated with him .

Director's daughter Carolspeculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction ., who hadpool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a poolthemed play called Corner Pocket , optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script .According to Bobby's agent , Martin Baum , Paul Newman 's agent turned down the part of Fast Eddie . Newman was originally unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless , being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two for the.offeredthe part after seeing him on The Mike Wallace Interview . When Taylor was forced to drop out ofbecause of shootingon Cleopatra , Newman was freed up to take the role , which he accepted after reading just half of the script . No one associated with the production officially notifiedor his representatives that he had been replaced ; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race . filmed Theover six weeks , entirely in New York City . Much of the action was filmed at two nowdefunct pool halls ,'s and AmesAcademy . Other shooting locations included aon East 82nd Street , which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton 's character, and the Manhattanbus terminal . The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders . Willieserved as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors . All of Gleason 's shots were his own ; they were filmed in wideangle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames ., in pursuit of the style he termed " neoneorealistic " , hired actual street thugs , enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras . Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way to town  and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny 's Bar which establishes Preacher is a.Early shooting put more focus on the pool playing , but during filmingmade the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie 's characters . Despite the change in emphasis ,still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie 's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah , through the positioning of the characters in the frame . For example , when Eddie is playing, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but abovewhile still below Bert in a three shot . When Sarah enters the room , she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert . When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah 's body , Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert , ending up on top of him . Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat.Theis fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being ,within the context of winning and losing . Describing the film , Robertsaid : " My protagonist , Fast Eddie , wants to become a great pool player , but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being . Heselfawareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game . " Roger with this assessment , citing Theas " one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering , by accepting reality instead of his dreams . "The film was also somewhat autobiographical for, relating to his dealings with the House UnAmerican Activities Committee . A screenwriter during the 1930s and ' 40s , he had been involved with the Communist Party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his firstappearance . Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members . Similarly ,sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in apact to gain character .Film and theatre historian has identified Theas one of a handful of films from the early 1960s that redefined the relationship of films to their audiences . This new relationship , he writes , is " one of challenge rather than, of doubt rather than certainty .
